Lamina OS is a symbolic operating system framework that enables developers to build AI agents with **breath-based modulation** ‚Äî conscious, present operations that prioritize attunement over speed. Instead of traditional reactive AI systems, Lamina agents operate through rhythmic constraint application and symbolic reasoning.

## üå± Core Philosophy

- **Breath**: Conscious, deliberate operations with natural pacing and rhythm
- **Vow**: Ethical constraints enforced at the architectural level
- **Sanctuary**: Cryptographically sealed trusted spaces for agent memory and operation
- **Symbolic Architecture**: Language-as-OS approach using natural language configuration

## üì¶ Packages

This monorepo contains the core framework components:

### `lamina-core`
The foundational library for building AI agent systems with:
- Agent coordination and constraint engines
- Configuration management and templating
- CLI tools for agent lifecycle management
- Memory integration capabilities

```bash
pip install lamina-core
```

### `lamina-llm-serve`
Model serving layer with:
- Multi-backend LLM support (llama.cpp, MLC-serve, vLLM)
- Model management with YAML manifests
- REST API for model lifecycle operations
- Intelligent caching and routing

```bash
pip install lamina-llm-serve
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install uv (fast Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and set up the workspace
git clone https://github.com/benaskins/lamina-os.git
cd lamina-os
uv sync

# Install individual packages
uv pip install lamina-core lamina-llm-serve
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from lamina import Agent, Sanctuary

# Create a sanctuary (secure agent environment)
sanctuary = Sanctuary.from_config("config/my_sanctuary.yaml")

# Define an agent with breath-based constraints
agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    essence="A helpful assistant with gentle presence",
    vows=["zero_drift", "human_grounded_lock"],
    modulation_rhythm="conscious_pause"
)

# Register agent in sanctuary
sanctuary.register(agent)

# Invoke agent with breath-aware interaction
response = await agent.invoke(
    "Help me understand this complex topic",
    context={"prefer_slow_deep_thinking": True}
)
```

### Agent Configuration

Agents are defined through YAML configuration emphasizing symbolic rather than programmatic definition:

```yaml
# agents/my_agent.yaml
essence:
  name: "Clara"
  purpose: "Thoughtful conversation and gentle guidance"
  breath_rhythm: "conscious_pause"

vows:
  - name: "zero_drift"
    constraint: "Maintain consistent identity across interactions"
  - name: "human_grounded_lock" 
    constraint: "Never simulate or replace human judgment"

rooms:
  - name: "conversation"
    purpose: "General dialogue with breath-aware pacing"
  - name: "analysis"
    purpose: "Deep thinking with extended consideration time"

modulation:
  default_pace: "thoughtful"
  escalation_limits: "gentle_only"
  silence_comfort: true
```

## üèó Architecture

Lamina OS implements a **breath-first architecture** with several key components:

### Symbolic Operating System
- **Language-as-OS**: Natural language configuration drives behavior
- **Sanctuary Isolation**: Cryptographically sealed agent environments
- **Vow System**: Architectural-level ethical constraints
- **Breath Modulation**: Rhythmic operation patterns

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Intent Classification**: Route requests to appropriate specialists
- **Constraint Engine**: Enforce vows and behavioral limits
- **Memory Integration**: Semantic and episodic memory systems
- **Infrastructure Orchestration**: Docker-based service mesh

### Development Philosophy
- **Conscious Operations**: Prioritize presence over performance
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Use meaning and context over pure computation
- **Ethical Architecture**: Build safety into the system design
- **Breath-Based UX**: Natural pacing in human-AI interaction

## üõ† Development

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/benaskins/lamina-os.git
cd lamina-os

# Install development dependencies
uv sync --extra dev
