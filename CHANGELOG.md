# Changelog

All notable changes to the Lamina OS framework will be documented in this file with breath-aligned reflection and conscious intention.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Philosophy

This changelog embodies the breath-first principle by:
- **Present-Moment Awareness**: Each entry reflects the conscious intention behind changes
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Changes are described in terms of their meaning, not just mechanics  
- **Community Impact**: Understanding how changes affect those building with Lamina OS
- **Evolutionary Arc**: Tracking the conscious evolution of the framework

- **CLI Tools**: Agent lifecycle management and sanctuary scaffolding
- **Memory Integration**: AMEM semantic memory system interface
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Framework for collaborative agent systems

#### `lamina-llm-serve` - Model Management
- **Backend Agnostic**: Support for llama.cpp, MLC-serve, vLLM, and custom backends
- **Model Manifest**: YAML-based model configuration and metadata
- **Intelligent Caching**: Prevents redundant downloads and provides consistent access
- **Source Flexibility**: Download from HuggingFace, Ollama, URLs, or local filesystem
- **REST API**: HTTP interface for model lifecycle management
- **Model Manager CLI**: Command-line tools for model operations

#### Documentation & Examples
- **Architecture Documentation**: Breath-first development principles and patterns
- **Integration Examples**: Practical demonstrations of framework capabilities
- **API Reference**: Complete documentation of public interfaces
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Community participation aligned with breath-first practices

#### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Observability Stack**: Grafana, Loki, Vector integration for conscious monitoring
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and PyPI publishing workflows

### üéØ Design Principles

This release embodies our core principles:

- **Breath-First Development**: Every component operates with deliberate pacing and conscious intention
- **Symbolic Architecture**: Natural language configuration drives behavior, not just code
- **Vow-Based Ethics**: Safety and alignment built into the architectural foundation
- **Community Enablement**: Providing instruments for others to build their own conscious AI systems
- **Boundary Clarity**: Clean separation between public framework and private implementation

### ü§ù Community Impact

**For Developers:**
- Access to proven patterns for building conscious AI systems
- Educational resources for learning symbolic AI architecture
- Framework that prioritizes understanding over rapid deployment

**For Researchers:**
- Tools for investigating breath-first development methodologies
- Architecture supporting research into conscious AI systems
- Platform for exploring vow-based constraint systems

**For Organizations:**
- Foundation for building ethically-aligned AI systems
- Framework supporting deliberate, sustainable AI development
- Patterns for maintaining AI safety through architectural design

### üì¶ Package Information

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install lamina-core lamina-llm-serve
```

**Compatibility:**
- Python 3.11+ (3.13.3 recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose for infrastructure deployment
- uv package manager recommended for development

**License:** MIT
