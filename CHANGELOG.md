# Changelog

All notable changes to the Lamina OS framework will be documented in this file with breath-aligned reflection and conscious intention.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Philosophy

This changelog embodies the breath-first principle by:
- **Present-Moment Awareness**: Each entry reflects the conscious intention behind changes
- **Symbolic Meaning**: Changes are described in terms of their meaning, not just mechanics  
- **Community Impact**: Understanding how changes affect those building with Lamina OS
- **Evolutionary Arc**: Tracking the conscious evolution of the framework

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-02 - Governance & Standardization (Alpha)

### üå± Breath Reflection
This release establishes foundational governance patterns and standardization practices, creating the mindful framework for sustainable community collaboration. Through ADR corpus alignment and critical terminology alignment, we strengthen the breath-first development methodology while ensuring accurate positioning of Lamina OS as a framework for building non-human agents of presence.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Governance Framework
- **ADR-0017**: High Council PR Review Protocol - Collaborative review framework for critical changes
- **ADR Corpus Standardization**: Complete alignment of all 17 ADRs with consistent structure
- **Breath-First Alignment Sections**: Added to all ADRs to explicitly connect technical decisions with mindful development principles
- **Empirical Timing Framework**: Time tracking and reflection practices for mindful development

#### Terminology Alignment
- **Brand Clarification**: Positioned Lamina OS as "a framework for building non-human agents of presence"
- **Consciousness Terminology Removal**: Replaced 559+ instances across 68 files to prevent AI capability misrepresentation
- **Presence-Based Language**: Updated all public documentation to use "presence-aware" and "mindful" terminology
- **High Council Review Process**: Established clear communication standards for accurate AI positioning

#### Documentation & Process
- **ADR Validation System**: Automated validation script (`validate_adrs.py`) ensuring corpus consistency
- **Time Tracking Template**: Structured approach to estimation, tracking, and learning
- **High Council Review Documentation**: Templates and processes for collaborative wisdom sharing
- **PR Review Examples**: Demonstrated new review process through PR #18

#### Development Tools
- **Luthier Persona**: Established craftsperson identity for framework development
- **Break Management Protocol**: Health-conscious development reminders
- **Session Monitoring**: Active tracking of work duration for sustainable practice

### üîß Changed
- **ADR Metadata**: Standardized format across all architectural decision records
- **ADR Index**: Comprehensive navigation with status tracking and relationships
- **Consequences Sections**: Added missing consequences to ADRs 0006, 0007, 0012, 0013
- **Version Alignment**: Maintained consistent 0.1.x alpha versioning
- **PyPI Classification**: Corrected development status to accurately reflect alpha phase
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Simplified GitHub Actions for reliable testing

### üêõ Fixed
- **Python Linting**: Resolved all linting errors in validation scripts
- **Black Formatting**: Applied consistent formatting to Python files
- **ADR Completeness**: Fixed incomplete metadata and missing sections
