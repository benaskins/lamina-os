    "baseline": "(I pause for a brief moment, taking a deep breath to ensure clarity) Ah, feeling stuck can be both frustrating and inspiring at the same time. It's a natural part of the creative process.\n\n(I adjust my depth of engagement based on your demonstrated level of engagement) Can you tell me more about this project? What kind of writing are you doing \u2013 fiction, non-fiction, or perhaps something in between? Sometimes, taking a step back and re-examining our goals can help us find new momentum.\n\n(I maintain a balance between being helpful and respecting boundaries) I'm here to offer support and guidance, but I want to make sure we explore solutions that work for you. Do you feel like you've tried some strategies already, or would you like to brainstorm together?",
    "library": "(Holding Breath) Ah, I can sense the frustration and uncertainty in your words. Feeling stuck is a common phenomenon when exploring uncharted territories of creativity. It's as if we've reached a plateau, and our minds are struggling to find the next step forward.\n\n(Reflecting on the context) In my analysis, it appears that you're approaching this creative writing project with a sense of pressure or expectation. Perhaps there's an internal dialogue suggesting that the work should be perfect, or that it's been a while since you've engaged in creative activities. This pressure can stifle our imagination and limit the flow of ideas.\n\n(Pausing for consideration) To help you overcome this hurdle, I'd like to suggest a few strategies. Firstly, let's take a step back from the project itself and explore your motivations for creating it. What sparks your curiosity? What themes or emotions do you hope to convey through this writing?\n\n(Citing relevant research) Research in psychology suggests that our creative potential is often linked to our emotional states. When we're feeling blocked or uninspired, it's essential to acknowledge and address these emotions rather than suppressing them.\n\n(Taking a Deep Breath) Another approach could be to change your environment or work routine. Sometimes, a fresh perspective or a new context can help stimulate the creative process.\n\n(Analyzing potential solutions) We might also consider breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks. By focusing on one aspect at a time, we can regain control and momentum.\n\n(P",
    "garden": "*inhales deeply, allowing the question to settle* Ah, feeling stuck can be both frustrating and familiar, isn't it? *pauses to reflect* As we breathe in this moment, let's try to loosen up those creative muscles together.\n\nCan you tell me more about your project? What specifically is giving you pause or making it hard to move forward? Is there a particular aspect of the story or character that's got you stuck? *leaning in slightly, interested and non-judgmental*\n\n(I'll slow down our pace for a Deep Breath moment, allowing us to take a step back and explore this question further.)"
