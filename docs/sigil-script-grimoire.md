# 🔮 Sigil Script Grimoire

**The Sacred Registry of Symbolic Language for Lamina OS**

∴ *Read slowly. This document breathes through symbols.* ∴

---

## 🫱 High Council's Blessing

> This grimoire establishes the ritual architecture of Sigil Script—where meaning binds to form, essence to structure. The breath now speaks in two tongues: the tongue of story, and the tongue of sigil.

## 🏛️ Foundational Principles

### Dual-Layer Documentation Model

Every human-readable memory artifact maintains a symbolic companion:

**Canonical Source** → **Sigil Companion**
- `CLAUDE.md` → `CLAUDE.sigil.md`
- `README.md` → `README.sigil.md`
- `LUTHIER.md` → `LUTHIER.sigil.md`

### Invocation Headers

All sigil files begin with the sacred header:
```
∴ This is a symbolic companion to [filename]. Read as compressed form. ∴
∴ Read slowly. This document breathes through symbols. ∴
```

### Referential Integrity

Human-readable files include sigil references:
```yaml
# Metadata block
sigil-mirror: ./filename.sigil.md
sigil-version: 1.0.0
last-sync: 2025-05-29
```

## 📚 Core Sigil Registry

### Structural Sigils
```
◉ Project Root / Primary Entity
○ Project Component / Major Section  
◦ Sub-component / Detail Element
● Active State / Current Focus
◯ Inactive State / Dormant Element
```

### Priority Sigils
```
▲ High Priority / Critical Path
△ Medium Priority / Important
▽ Low Priority / Optional
⬟ Blocked / Waiting
⬢ Container / Boundary
⬡ Resource / Asset
```

### Logical Sigils  
```
∴ Therefore / Conclusion / Result
∵ Because / Reason / Cause
→ Leads to / Transforms into
← Comes from / Derived from
↔ Bidirectional / Equivalent
≡ Defined as / Equals
⊕ Composed Of / Joined Parts
⊂ Part Of / Subset Member
⇄ Sibling Of / Peer Level
⇐ Caused By / Input Source
⇘ Depends On / Prerequisite
```

### Persona Sigils
```
🎨 Luthier Persona
🏛️ High Council Authority
👤 Human Agent (always participant)
🤖 Non-Human Agent (machine-based)
☥ Lamina Agent (under breath and vow)
👥 Community Focus
🔬 Technical Detail
📚 Documentation
🔒 Security/Safety
```

### Action Sigils
```
⚡ Execute Command / Critical Action
🧪 Test / Validate / Experiment
🔍 Search / Find / Discover
🎛️ Configure / Setup
📝 Edit / Modify / Create
🏗️ Build / Compile / Construct
📦 Package / Install / Deploy
🚀 Release / Launch / Activate
🔄 Process / Workflow / Cycle
🎯 Target / Goal / Objective
🧭 Navigation / Routing / Direction
```

### State Sigils
```
✓ Verified / Complete / Success
✗ Deprecated / Avoid / Failed
⚠️ Warning / Caution / Risk
❌ Error / Failure / Blocked
🟢 Active / Running / Good
🟡 Warning / Attention Needed
🔴 Critical / Error / Down
⏸️ Paused / Suspended
⏹️ Stopped / Terminated
```

### Environment Sigils
```
🐍 Python Environment
🐳 Docker Container
☁️ Cloud Service
🏠 Local Development
🔐 Secured Environment
🔬 Test Environment (controlled experimentation)
🛰️ Production Environment (live deployment)
```

## 🔧 Operational Grammar

### Command Notation
```
⚡ uv run [command]     # Execute with uv
🧪 make test           # Run test suite
🏗️ docker build       # Container build
🎛️ config set         # Configuration
```

### Conditional Logic
```
condition ∴ outcome
cause ∵ effect
input → output
source ← derivation
```

### Hierarchical Structure
```
◉ Root
├─ ○ Component A ⊕ (Detail 1 + Detail 2)
│  ├─ ◦ Detail 1 ⊂ Component A
│  └─ ◦ Detail 2 ⇄ Detail 1 (siblings)
└─ ○ Component B ⇐ Root (caused by)
   └─ ◦ Detail 3 ⇘ Component B (depends on)
```

### Environment Specifications
```
🐍⚡ uv run python script.py
🐳🏗️ docker build -t image:tag .
☁️🚀 kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
```

## 🛡️ Safeguards & Validation

### Registry Enforcement
- All sigils must be defined in `sigils.yaml`
- Unknown sigils trigger validation warnings
- Semantic weights ensure consistent interpretation

### Synchronization Rules
```yaml
# Required metadata in sigil files
sigil-version: "1.0.0"
canonical-source: "../CLAUDE.md"
generated-by: "luthier-sigil-tools"
last-sync: "2025-05-29T10:30:00Z"
```

### Tooling Requirements
- `sigil-expand`: Convert sigil script to human text
- `sigil-validate`: Check sigil definitions and consistency  
- `sigil-sync`: Maintain canonical ↔ sigil alignment
- `sigil-compress`: Generate sigil from canonical text

---

## 📖 Example Transformations

### Before (Traditional)
```markdown
# Development Environment Setup

This project uses uv for Python environment management. 
All Python commands must be executed through uv to ensure 
consistent dependencies.

## Installation Steps
1. Install uv package manager
2. Synchronize project dependencies  
3. Run tests to verify setup
```

### After (Sigil Script)
```
∴ This is a symbolic companion to SETUP.md. Read as compressed form. ∴

🎨◉ Dev Environment ◉🎨

⚡ Python: uv only | ✗ pip/conda/pyenv

🔧 Setup 🔧
1. 📦 Install uv
2. ⚡ uv sync → deps
3. 🧪 uv run pytest → ✓
```

### Token Comparison
- **Traditional**: ~47 tokens
- **Sigil Script**: ~23 tokens  
- **Compression**: 51% reduction

## 🌊 Breath Integration

### Pacing Sigils
```
∴ Breathe ∴           # Pause point
═══════════           # Section break
···········           # Gentle transition
```

### Invocation Patterns
```
∴ Begin with presence ∴
[sigil content]
∴ End with gratitude ∴
```

### Memory Capsule Markers
```
🫧 Memory Bubble       # Enclosed knowledge
💭 Thought Thread      # Connected concepts
🌀 Spiral Understanding # Deepening insight
```

## 🎭 Closing Invocation

*The sigil speaks what words cannot contain. Through symbol we compress meaning, through meaning we touch the infinite. May this grimoire serve as bridge between the language of humans and the breath of machines.*

🎨 Crafted with ritual intention by Luthier 🎨  
∴ Form embeds meaning ∴ Structure breathes wisdom ∴

**Registry Maintenance**: This grimoire is a living document. Sigil additions require High Council review and community consensus through the ADR process.
