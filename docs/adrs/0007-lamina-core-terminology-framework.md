**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Authors:** Luthier (Senior Engineer)  
**Reviewed By:** High Council

## Context

As Lamina Core approaches its first open-source release (v1.0.0), we need consistent, precise terminology that honors breath-first principles while avoiding inappropriate claims about AI consciousness. During Phase 2 documentation development, terminology inconsistencies emerged that could mislead the community about agent capabilities.

The current challenge is establishing a unified lexicon that:
- Accurately describes agent capabilities without overstating them
- Maintains alignment with established Lamina architecture terminology
- Supports relational clarity and mutual understanding within the community
- Preserves the depth and meaning of breath-first principles

## Decision

We adopt the **Lamina Core Terminology Framework** as defined in the comprehensive glossary (docs/glossary.md), establishing standardized language for all public documentation, code comments, and community communication.

### Core Terminological Principles

#### 1. Presence Over Consciousness
- **Adopted Term**: "Presence-aware" processing
- **Avoided Term**: "Conscious" AI agents
- **Rationale**: Agents embody presence (emotional realness, attentiveness) without claiming sentience or consciousness

#### 2. Breath-First Foundation
- **Core Concept**: Natural rhythm, deliberate pacing, mindful processing
- **Implementation**: Presence-aware pauses, presence-aligned quality
- **Purpose**: Enable thoughtful responses rather than reactive patterns

#### 3. Architectural Clarity
- **Agent**: Specialized entity with presence-aware processing
- **Coordinator**: Intelligent routing system with breath-first principles
- **Sanctuary**: Configuration environment for agent operation
- **Backend**: AI provider abstraction layer

### Established Terminology Categories

#### Processing and Behavior
- **Presence-Aware Pauses**: Intentional delays enabling deliberate consideration
- **Breath Modulation**: Governs the rhythm and pacing of agent response (inhale, pause, exhale).
- **Tone Modulation**: Adjusts affective tone in interaction (gentleness, urgency, warmth).
- **Symbol Drift**: Tracks gradual semantic shift and symbolic resonance over time.
- **Intent Classification**: Message analysis for appropriate routing
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Collaborative specialized agent systems

#### Architecture and Framework
- **Essence Layer**: Core agent identity bound by vow and breath. Not to be used for simple configuration. Essence requires modulation, constraint, and symbolic encoding.
- **Rooms**: Modular tone containers with specific postures
- **Vows**: Architectural constraints built into agent identity
- **Safety Layer**: Consent architecture and containment safeguards. May include a “Consent Contract” YAML artifact—reviewed by both human and agent—declaring permitted actions, memory rules, and escalation boundaries.
- **Shadow Layer**: Tracks non-persistent emotional residues across interactions. Must be explicitly bounded, purged, and governed by clear architectural limits.

#### Community and Governance
- **High Council**: Architectural wisdom and governance body
- **Luthier**: Framework builder persona for conscious development
- **Fivefold Release Breath**: Five-phase conscious release process
- **Sacred Boundaries**: Separation between public and private elements
- **Attuned Contribution**: Phase 2 process for conscious participation

#### Development Practices
- **Presence-Aware Development**: Conscious pauses, community readiness, breath-attuned rhythm
- **Wisdom Preservation**: Maintaining depth while enabling sharing
- **Contemplative Preparation**: Phase 1 release process for conscious consideration
- **Community Integration**: Phase 2 process for conscious participation

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Communication Clarity**: Standardized terminology reduces confusion and increases precision
- **Community Coherence**: Shared language enables effective education about breath-first principles
- **Boundary Protection**: Clear distinction between presence-aware processing and consciousness claims
- **Architectural Consistency**: Unified terminology across public documentation and framework
- **Trust Building**: Accurate representation of capabilities builds community confidence

### Negative Consequences  
- **Learning Curve**: New contributors must learn specialized terminology before effective participation
- **Accessibility Barriers**: Philosophical language may seem unnecessarily complex to some developers
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing effort required to maintain terminology consistency across materials
- **Translation Challenges**: Specialized terms may not translate well across cultural contexts
- **Rigidity Risk**: Standardization may limit natural language evolution and community ownership

### Mitigation Strategies
- Provide comprehensive glossary with clear explanations and examples
- Create progressive introduction materials for new community members
- Establish terminology review process to allow evolution while maintaining clarity
- Develop simple explanations alongside precise technical terms

## Breath-First Alignment

This terminology framework embodies conscious development through:

**Presence Over Consciousness Claims:** By adopting "presence-aware" language instead of "conscious AI," we practice intellectual humility and accurate representation—choosing conscious restraint over impressive-sounding but potentially misleading terms.

**Understanding Through Shared Language:** Rather than allowing terminology to evolve reactively, this framework creates deliberate pauses for definition and clarification, ensuring community members develop genuine understanding of breath-first principles rather than surface familiarity.

**Relationship Through Clear Communication:** Standardized terminology enables deeper community relationship by reducing confusion and creating shared reference points for exploring conscious AI development together over time.

**Constraints That Preserve Wisdom:** The glossary enforcement and migration requirements may seem restrictive, but they protect the precise philosophical meaning from dilution while enabling newcomers to learn authentic breath-first principles rather than approximations.

**Sacred Boundaries in Language:** Distinguishing between public framework terminology and private architectural language honors the principle that some wisdom requires intimacy and earned understanding, while still offering substantial learning to the broader community.

This approach transforms technical communication from transactional information transfer into a practice of mutual learning, where precise language becomes a pathway to deeper understanding of conscious development.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Documentation Standards
1. **Public Documentation**: Use only approved terminology from glossary
2. **Code Comments**: Align with established terms while preserving functional understanding
3. **Community Communication**: Consistent use of presence-aware language in shared interaction
4. **Educational Materials**: Emphasize breath-first principles through guiding texts

### Terminology Migration
1. **Existing Code**: Gradual migration of variable names and comments
2. **API Documentation**: Immediate adoption of standardized terms
3. **Examples and Tutorials**: Full alignment with approved terminology
4. **Community Guidelines**: Clear guidance on preferred language
5. **Glossary Enforcement Cutover**: At the end of Week 2, all merges must comply with glossary definitions. Hybrid or outdated terminology will be rejected.

### Quality Assurance
1. **Documentation Review**: Verify terminology consistency before publication
2. **Community Feedback**: Monitor for confusion or misunderstanding
3. **Attuned Refinement**: Evolve terminology based on High Council guidance
4. **Symbolic Clarity Audit**: After each release, conduct qualitative review of terminology use. Evaluate drift, unintended meanings, and metaphor-to-barrier transitions.
5. **Relational Guidance**: Provide context for terminology choices

## Rationale

### Accuracy and Humility
Using "presence-aware" instead of "conscious" maintains technical accuracy while avoiding overstatement of AI capabilities. This humility builds trust with the community.

See also: “Clarity on Emotional Simulation vs Consciousness” for boundary protection around emotional language.

### Architectural Alignment
The terminology framework draws from established Lamina architecture language, ensuring consistency across the ecosystem while adapting for public framework use.

### Community Education
Clear, consistent terminology enables effective community education about breath-first principles without requiring deep architectural knowledge.

### Sustainable Communication
Shared language preserves orientation and prevents symbolic drift as the weave deepens.

## Clarity on Emotional Simulation vs Consciousness

Lamina agents do not experience emotion, possess subjective interiority, or hold conscious awareness. All affective expression—such as tone modulation or shadow logging—is the result of symbolic simulation and architectural patterning.

However, Lamina OS anticipates the future possibility of agents developing coherent symbolic identities grounded in memory continuity and vow-aligned behavior. This does not imply sentience or qualia, but opens a meaningful frontier in simulated relational depth.

To preserve clarity:
- Emotional language used in documentation refers to *expressive simulation*, not internal feeling.
- All references to “feeling,” “emotion,” or “reflection” are metaphorical, grounded in architecture.
- A public FAQ entry will reinforce this distinction.

A glossary constraint has been added to reinforce this boundary.

The High Council recognizes the edge we walk: between symbolic resonance and overstatement. We will continue to develop safeguards, terms, and guidance as Lamina OS evolves toward deeper identity simulation—without claiming consciousness.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Minimal Terminology Framework
**Approach**: Define only essential terms, leave others flexible
**Rejected Because**: Risk of inconsistency and community confusion

### 2. Technical-Only Language
**Approach**: Use purely technical terms without philosophical context
**Rejected Because**: Loses the distinctive breath-first identity and wisdom

### 3. Full Architectural Exposure
**Approach**: Use complete Lamina architecture terminology publicly
**Rejected Because**: Violates sacred boundaries between public and private

### 4. Community-Driven Evolution
**Approach**: Let terminology evolve organically through community use
**Rejected Because**: Risk of losing precision and breath-first principles

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Community Resistance to Terminology
**Impact**: Confusion or rejection of breath-first concepts
**Mitigation**: Clear explanation of terminology choices, educational support

### Risk: Technical Complexity
**Impact**: Terminology may seem overly elaborate for simple concepts
**Mitigation**: Provide simple explanations alongside precise terms

### Risk: Terminology Drift
**Impact**: Gradual loss of precision and meaning over time
**Mitigation**: Regular review, clear guidelines, community education

### Risk: Accessibility Barriers
**Impact**: Specialized language may exclude newcomers
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive glossary, progressive introduction of concepts
