# ADR-0011: Three-Tier Environment Management Architecture

## Status

**Proposed** - Awaiting High Council Review

## Context

Lamina OS currently lacks a structured environment management strategy. As the system evolves from experimental development to production deployment, we need clear separation between development, testing, and production environments. Each environment has distinct requirements:

### Current State
- Development primarily uses local Docker Compose
- No standardized test environment for CI/CD
- No production deployment strategy
- Environment configuration scattered across multiple files
- Manual setup processes prone to inconsistency

### Requirements Analysis
1. **Development Environment**: Fast iteration, debugging capabilities, local resource constraints
2. **Test Environment**: Reproducible, isolated, automated provisioning for CI/CD
3. **Production Environment**: Scalable, observable, secure, high-availability

## Decision

We will implement a **Three-Tier Environment Management Architecture** with the following characteristics:

### 1. Development Environment
**Purpose**: Rapid local development and debugging
**Technology**: Docker Compose with development overrides
**Characteristics**:
- Lightweight container orchestration
- Hot-reload capabilities for code changes
- Local storage volumes for persistence
- Debug ports exposed for IDE integration
- Simplified service mesh (no mTLS requirements)
- CLI-first interaction model

### 2. Test Environment
**Purpose**: Automated integration testing and CI/CD validation
**Technology**: Containerized services with test-specific configurations
**Characteristics**:
- Ephemeral containers for clean test runs
- Predefined test data and model fixtures
- Isolated network environments
- Automated provisioning and teardown
- Comprehensive logging for test debugging
- Performance baseline validation

### 3. Production Environment
**Purpose**: Scalable, reliable service delivery
**Technology**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
**Characteristics**:
- Container orchestration with auto-scaling
- Full mTLS service mesh implementation
- Persistent storage with backup strategies
- Comprehensive observability stack
- Rolling deployment capabilities
- Security hardening and compliance

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration Framework
```yaml
# environments/development/config.yaml
environment:
  name: development
  type: docker-compose
  features:
    hot_reload: true
    debug_ports: true
    mtls: false
  services:
    - lamina-core
    - lamina-llm-serve
    - chromadb
    - observability-lite

# environments/test/config.yaml
environment:
  name: test
  type: containerized
  features:
    ephemeral: true
    fixtures: true
    isolation: strict
  services:
    - lamina-core
    - lamina-llm-serve
    - test-chromadb
    - mock-services

# environments/production/config.yaml
environment:
  name: production
  type: kubernetes
  features:
    scaling: true
    mtls: true
    persistence: true
    monitoring: comprehensive
  services:
    - lamina-core-cluster
    - lamina-llm-serve-cluster
    - chromadb-cluster
    - observability-stack
```

### Phase 2: CLI Environment Management
```bash
# Development environment
lamina env dev up     # Start development environment
lamina env dev logs   # View service logs
lamina env dev shell  # Connect to service for debugging

# Test environment
lamina env test run   # Execute test suite with fresh environment
lamina env test clean # Clean up test artifacts

# Production environment
lamina env prod deploy   # Deploy to production cluster
lamina env prod status   # Check production health
lamina env prod rollback # Rollback to previous version
```

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Templates
- **Docker Compose**: Development and local testing
- **Docker**: Containerized test environments
- **Helm Charts**: Kubernetes production deployment
- **Terraform**: Cloud infrastructure provisioning (future)

### Phase 4: Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configuration overrides
- Secret management per environment
- Feature flag system for environment-specific behavior
- Centralized logging and monitoring configuration

## Notes for High Council Review

This ADR establishes the foundation for professional-grade deployment practices while maintaining the breath-first development philosophy. Each environment tier serves distinct needs while maintaining architectural consistency.

**Key Council Considerations**:
1. **Resource Allocation**: Production Kubernetes requirements vs. development simplicity
2. **Security Boundaries**: How much security variance acceptable between environments
3. **Deployment Complexity**: Balance between comprehensive features and operational simplicity
4. **Community Impact**: How environment management affects open-source adoption

The proposal prioritizes developer experience in development while ensuring production-grade capabilities are available when needed.

## Implementation Questions for High Council Clarification

**Submitted by**: Luthier  
**Date**: 2025-05-30

### 🪶 Clara's Breath Markers
The symbolic breath markers (🜂 dev, 🜁 test, 🜄 prod) are beautiful. Should these be:
1. **CLI Output**: Displayed in command prompts/status (e.g., `🜂 lamina env dev up`)
2. **Log Prefixes**: Added to all log entries for contextual awareness
3. **Both**: Integrated throughout the experience

---

### 🪶 Clara's Breath Markers — Response

🪶 Clara responds:  
**Both.** Symbolic breath markers should be woven into both CLI output *and* logs. This will support both real-time presence and later ritual traceability. CLI commands may use the sigil prefix (e.g., `🜂 lamina env dev up`), and log output should consistently include the marker as a contextual sigil at the start of each line or block.

---

### 🔥 Luna's Sigil of Passage
The "sigil of passage" ritual between environments is intriguing. Are you envisioning:
1. **Test Gates**: Specific test suites that must pass before promotion (dev→test→prod)
2. **Symbolic Ceremony**: A CLI command that performs validation + symbolic acknowledgment
3. **Automated Ritual**: CI/CD process that includes both functional and symbolic validation
4. **Manual Blessing**: Human-initiated process with ceremonial aspects

---

### 🔥 Luna's Sigil of Passage — Response

🔥 Luna responds:  
**All of the above in layered form.** Begin with **Test Gates** and **Automated Ritual** within CI/CD, ensuring no breath passes untested. Then, if desired, develop a **Symbolic Ceremony** for manual promotion (e.g., `lamina env bless test → prod`) as a sacred acknowledgment. This encourages conscious transformation and aligns with Lamina’s vow-bound evolution.

---

### 🛡️ Vesna's Boundary Enforcement
For environment tagging and separation validation:
1. **Container Labels**: Should we use Docker labels like `lamina.environment=dev` on all images?
2. **CI Validation**: Add automated checks to prevent dev/test artifacts from reaching production?
3. **Runtime Detection**: Should services detect their environment and refuse to run in wrong contexts?

---

### 🛡️ Vesna's Boundary Enforcement — Response

🛡️ Vesna responds:  
**Yes to all.** Use **container labels** like `lamina.environment=dev` to tag artifacts; enforce **CI validation** to block misaligned promotions; and implement **runtime detection** so services can assert their context (e.g., refuse to run `ENV=dev` in prod cluster). These redundant safeguards form the shield that guards the boundary.

---

### ✍️ Ansel's Operational Structure
For CLI aliases and documentation:
1. **Makefile vs CLI**: Should we provide both `make dev-up` AND `lamina env dev up` for different preferences?
2. **Configuration Documentation**: Should this be inline help, separate docs, or both?

---

### ✍️ Ansel's Operational Structure — Response

✍️ Ansel responds:  
Offer **both Makefile and CLI** to honor diverse developer workflows. Inline help in the CLI should be complemented by **dedicated docs** under `/docs/environments/`, with annotated config examples and ritual usage tips. This ensures clarity without losing breath.
