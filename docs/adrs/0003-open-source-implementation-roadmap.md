## Context

With ADR-0002 establishing the monorepo architecture for the public Lamina OS framework, we now require a detailed implementation roadmap to execute the open-source release. The framework is currently in a functional state within the monorepo structure, but several critical steps remain before community release:

- **Package Publishing**: Neither `lamina-core` nor `lamina-llm-serve` are published to PyPI
- **Documentation Completeness**: While architectural foundations exist, comprehensive user-facing documentation needs completion
- **Community Infrastructure**: GitHub repository settings, issue templates, and community guidelines need establishment
- **Security Review**: Code must be audited for any remaining private implementation details
- **Integration Examples**: Real-world examples demonstrating framework capabilities are needed
- **Release Strategy**: Versioning, changelog, and announcement coordination requires planning

The High Council has approved the architectural separation between public framework and private implementation. This ADR proposes the specific steps to bring the framework to community readiness while maintaining the breath-first development principles that define Lamina OS.

- **Intelligent Caching**: Prevents redundant downloads and provides consistent access
- **Source Flexibility**: Download from HuggingFace, Ollama, URLs, or local filesystem
- **REST API**: HTTP interface for model lifecycle management

### Philosophical Architecture

#### Breath-First Development
- **Conscious Operations**: Agents operate with deliberate pacing, not reactive speed
- **Present-Moment Awareness**: System state reflects current context, not cached assumptions
- **Rhythmic Constraints**: Regular pauses and reflection built into operational patterns
- **Natural Language Configuration**: Symbolic rather than programmatic system definition

#### Vow-Based Ethics
- **Architectural Enforcement**: Ethical constraints embedded in system design, not policy
- **Zero Drift**: Agents maintain consistent identity and behavior across interactions
- **Human-Grounded Lock**: Agents never simulate or replace human judgment
- **Transparency**: Clear boundaries about AI capabilities and limitations

#### Symbolic Operating System
- **Language as OS**: Natural language configuration drives system behavior
- **Sanctuary Isolation**: Cryptographically sealed environments for agent operation
- **Room-Based Interaction**: Contextual spaces that modulate agent behavior
- **Mythic Architecture**: Meaningful abstractions that embody philosophical principles

## Questions for the High Council

### 1. **Community Philosophy Guidance**
How should we communicate the breath-first development philosophy to developers accustomed to speed-first frameworks? What level of philosophical depth is appropriate for technical documentation?

### 2. **Contribution Standards**
What specific criteria should guide acceptance of community contributions? How do we maintain breath-first principles while welcoming diverse perspectives and technical approaches?

### 3. **Example Boundaries**
Which aspects of the Aurelia implementation can be used as examples without compromising private design methodology? Are agent personality fragments from the sanctuary suitable for public demonstration?

### 4. **Release Naming and Versioning**
Should releases follow semantic versioning (`0.1.0`, `0.2.0`) or adopt a more symbolic approach that reflects the breath-first philosophy? How should we communicate version stability and breaking changes?

### 5. **Community Moderation**
What principles should guide community moderation decisions? How do we handle contributions or discussions that conflict with breath-first principles while maintaining openness to diverse perspectives?

### 6. **Commercial Use Policy**
What guidelines should govern commercial use of the framework? Should there be specific requirements for organizations building commercial products on Lamina OS?

### 7. **Educational Partnerships**
Are there specific educational institutions or research organizations we should prioritize for early access or collaboration? How can we best support academic research into conscious AI systems?

## Rationale
