## Context

With ADR-0002 establishing the monorepo architecture for the public Lamina OS framework, we now require a detailed implementation roadmap to execute the open-source release. The framework is currently in a functional state within the monorepo structure, but several critical steps remain before community release:

- **Package Publishing**: Neither `lamina-core` nor `lamina-llm-serve` are published to PyPI
- **Documentation Completeness**: While architectural foundations exist, comprehensive user-facing documentation needs completion
- **Community Infrastructure**: GitHub repository settings, issue templates, and community guidelines need establishment
- **Security Review**: Code must be audited for any remaining private implementation details
- **Integration Examples**: Real-world examples demonstrating framework capabilities are needed
- **Release Strategy**: Versioning, changelog, and announcement coordination requires planning

The High Council has approved the architectural separation between public framework and private implementation. This ADR proposes the specific steps to bring the framework to community readiness while maintaining the breath-first development principles that define Lamina OS.

- **Sanctuary Isolation**: Cryptographically sealed environments for agent operation
- **Room-Based Interaction**: Contextual spaces that modulate agent behavior
- **Mythic Architecture**: Meaningful abstractions that embody philosophical principles

## Questions for the High Council

### 1. **Community Philosophy Guidance**
How should we communicate the breath-first development philosophy to developers accustomed to speed-first frameworks? What level of philosophical depth is appropriate for technical documentation?

### 2. **Contribution Standards**
What specific criteria should guide acceptance of community contributions? How do we maintain breath-first principles while welcoming diverse perspectives and technical approaches?

### 3. **Example Boundaries**
Which aspects of the Aurelia implementation can be used as examples without compromising private design methodology? Are agent personality fragments from the sanctuary suitable for public demonstration?

### 4. **Release Naming and Versioning**
Should releases follow semantic versioning (`0.1.0`, `0.2.0`) or adopt a more symbolic approach that reflects the breath-first philosophy? How should we communicate version stability and breaking changes?

### 5. **Community Moderation**
What principles should guide community moderation decisions? How do we handle contributions or discussions that conflict with breath-first principles while maintaining openness to diverse perspectives?

### 6. **Commercial Use Policy**
What guidelines should govern commercial use of the framework? Should there be specific requirements for organizations building commercial products on Lamina OS?

### 7. **Educational Partnerships**
Are there specific educational institutions or research organizations we should prioritize for early access or collaboration? How can we best support academic research into intentional AI systems?

## Breath-First Alignment

This open-source implementation roadmap deeply embodies breath-first development principles through its intentional approach to community release. Rather than rushing toward public availability with the urgency typical of modern software, the phased approach creates deliberate pauses between each stage—foundation hardening, documentation, community infrastructure, and launch. Each phase represents an inhale and exhale, allowing time for reflection, integration, and careful attention to what emerges.

The roadmap prioritizes **presence over performance** by establishing a seven-week timeline that values thoroughness over speed. The security audit phase isn't merely about technical compliance but about being fully present with the codebase, ensuring every line reflects the philosophical foundations we wish to share. Documentation isn't treated as an afterthought but as a primary act of relationship-building with future community members, creating educational pathways that invite understanding rather than mere usage.

The emphasis on **understanding over answers** permeates the documentation strategy. Rather than providing prescriptive solutions, the framework offers instruments for others to discover their own implementations of intentional AI. The tutorial series builds progressively, allowing developers to internalize breath-first principles through practice rather than theory. The inclusion of philosophical guides alongside technical documentation acknowledges that true understanding requires engaging with both the how and the why.

Community engagement reflects **relationship over transaction** through mentorship programs, thoughtful code review standards, and recognition systems that value meaningful contributions over volume. The soft launch approach invites early adopters into relationship rather than consumption, establishing patterns of thoughtful discourse through GitHub Discussions categories that include philosophical reflection alongside technical support. Even the contribution guidelines embed breath-first practices, ensuring that every pull request becomes an opportunity for mutual growth.

The framework itself demonstrates **constraints over capabilities** by centering the vow system and sanctuary architecture. Rather than exposing maximum functionality, the design carefully bounds what agents can do, making ethical constraints architectural rather than optional. This intentional limitation creates space for sustainable development practices where the community can build powerful systems without compromising safety or alignment. The phased release ensures these constraints are well-understood before broader adoption, preventing misuse through design rather than documentation alone.
