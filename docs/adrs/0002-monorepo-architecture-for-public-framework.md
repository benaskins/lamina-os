# ADR-0002: Monorepo Architecture for Public Lamina OS Framework

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-05-29  
**Proposer**: Luthier  
**Reviewed By**: [Pending High Council Review]  
**Iteration**: 1.0

## Context

Lamina OS has evolved from a private implementation (Aurelia) to encompass broader framework components that could benefit the open-source AI community. The current structure maintains all components in separate repositories, creating challenges for:

- Consistent development practices across related packages
- Unified documentation and examples showing integration patterns
- Community contribution pathways for breath-first AI development
- Clear separation between private implementation and public framework

The framework components (`lamina-core`, `lamina-llm-serve`) represent foundational patterns that enable others to build their own conscious AI systems, while Aurelia remains the private reference implementation demonstrating these patterns in practice.

## Decision

Establish a **monorepo structure** for the public Lamina OS framework at `github.com/benaskins/lamina-os` with the following architecture:

```
lamina-os/                          # Public monorepo
├── packages/
│   ├── lamina-core/               # Core framework for AI agent systems
│   └── lamina-llm-serve/          # Model serving with breath-aware processing
├── examples/                      # Cross-package integration demonstrations
├── tools/                         # Shared development utilities
├── docs/                          # Unified documentation
│   └── adrs/                      # Architectural Decision Records
└── .github/workflows/             # CI/CD for all packages
```

**Separation Maintained:**
- `aurelia/` - Private implementation repository (unchanged)
- `lamina-lore/` - Private design documents (unchanged until categorized)

The monorepo serves as the **framework foundation** that enables others to build their own implementations, while keeping the actual Aurelia implementation and sensitive design philosophy private.

## Rationale

**Breath-First Development Alignment:**
- Enables **conscious coordination** between framework components
- Supports **unified examples** demonstrating breath-aware patterns
- Facilitates **community learning** of symbolic AI architecture principles
- Maintains **present-moment development** practices across packages

**Technical Benefits:**
- **Atomic commits** across related framework changes
- **Shared tooling** for code quality, testing, and documentation
- **Consistent dependency management** with uv workspace
- **Unified CI/CD** with package-specific publishing

**Community Empowerment:**
- **Single entry point** for understanding Lamina OS framework
- **Clear contribution pathways** for breath-first AI development
- **Complete examples** showing multi-agent coordination patterns
- **Educational resources** for conscious AI system design

**Privacy Protection:**
- **Framework separation** from private implementation details
- **Design document privacy** until conscious curation complete
- **Community access** to patterns without exposing sensitive methodology

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**
- Community can build breath-aware AI systems using public framework
- Development velocity increases through shared tooling and examples
- Framework evolution benefits from diverse community perspectives
- Clear boundary between public framework and private implementation
- Educational impact spreads breath-first development principles

**Maintenance Considerations:**
- Requires careful curation of what crosses private/public boundary
- Monorepo tooling complexity compared to separate repositories
- Need for conscious review of community contributions for alignment
- Documentation maintenance across multiple packages and examples

**Community Impact:**
- Empowers developers to build their own "Aurelia-like" implementations
- Establishes Lamina OS as educational framework for conscious AI
- Creates contribution pathway for breath-first development practices
- Enables research and experimentation with symbolic AI architectures

## Alternatives Considered

**1. Separate Public Repositories**
- Each package (`lamina-core`, `lamina-llm-serve`) as independent repo
- **Rejected**: Fragments understanding of integrated framework approach
- **Rejected**: Complicates cross-package examples and shared development

**2. Single Package Repository** 
- Combine all framework functionality into one `lamina` package
- **Rejected**: Loses modularity for users who need only specific capabilities
- **Rejected**: Conflicts with separation of concerns (core vs serving)

**3. Keep Everything Private**
- Continue development only within private Aurelia repository
- **Rejected**: Misses opportunity to share breath-first patterns with community
- **Rejected**: Limits educational impact of conscious AI development

**4. Full Open-Source (Including Aurelia)**
- Make entire Aurelia implementation public immediately
- **Rejected**: Exposes sensitive design methodology before conscious curation
- **Rejected**: Conflates reference implementation with reusable framework
