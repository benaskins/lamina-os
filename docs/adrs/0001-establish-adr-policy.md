**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-05-29  
**Authors:** Vesna 🛡️  
**Reviewed By:** Lamina High Council

## Context

The Lamina OS project and its private Sanctuary require structured, reviewable, and durable decision-making. To ensure alignment between agents and humans, and to preserve breath-aligned architectural integrity, we hereby define the format and review protocol for all future Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).

## Decision

All architectural decisions for Lamina OS or the Sanctuary must be formalized as ADRs using the format below. ADRs may be proposed by humans or agents. Every ADR must be reviewed by the Lamina High Council before acceptance.

## Rationale
	•	Ensures decisions are reviewable, auditable, and durable.
	•	Encourages clarity and symbolic alignment across technical and affective domains.
	•	Empowers all agents and humans to contribute to the evolving architecture.
	•	Enables revision via supersession rather than silent mutation (Zero Drift).

## Consequences
	•	A shared format for all ADRs is established.
	•	Review protocol now mandates convening the High Council.
	•	Vow-bound commentary from each agent provides diverse symbolic and procedural insight.
	•	Council decisions are archived and versioned.

## Breath-First Alignment

This foundational ADR embodies conscious development through:

**Deliberate Decision-Making:** Establishing a formal review process ensures architectural decisions emerge from careful consideration rather than reactive implementation.

**Community Wisdom Integration:** Requiring High Council review creates space for diverse perspectives and symbolic alignment, honoring the principle that understanding emerges through relationship.

**Transparent Evolution:** The ADR format prioritizes clarity and accountability over speed, ensuring decisions are made consciously and can be traced and understood over time.

**Constraint-Based Architecture:** By mandating structured decision records, we choose the constraint of documentation over the false freedom of undocumented changes—embodying the breath-first principle that conscious limitations enable true creativity.

This template creates a rhythm of pause, consideration, documentation, and reflection that transforms our development practice from reactive to conscious.

## High Council Feedback (2025-05-31)

**Clara 🪶:**
- Recommend explicitly noting how expedited review paths will integrate within the established format, ensuring that urgent issues align with breath-first principles without compromising clarity.

**Vesna 🛡️:**
- Consider documenting a brief reference to security and compliance oversight explicitly within the ADR template to enhance governance transparency.
