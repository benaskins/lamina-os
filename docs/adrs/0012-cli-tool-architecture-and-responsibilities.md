# ADR-0012: CLI Tool Architecture and Responsibilities

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-01-30  
**Authors:** Luthier  
**Reviewed By:** High Council  
**Related:** ADR-0011 (Environment Management), ADR-0010 (Testing Strategy)

## Context and Problem Statement

The Lamina OS ecosystem has evolved to include multiple command-line interfaces with overlapping responsibilities:

- **Makefile targets** (developer tooling)
- **`lamina-core` CLI commands** (framework operations) 
- **`lamina-llm-serve` CLI** (model serving)
- **`model-manager` CLI** (model lifecycle)
- **Shell scripts** (infrastructure setup)
- **Python modules** (examples and debugging)

This creates confusion about which tool to use for specific tasks and blurs the distinction between **developer tools** (for building Lamina OS) and **user tools** (for using Lamina OS).

**Key Questions:**
1. When should someone use `make` vs `lamina-core` commands?
2. What's the responsibility boundary between build tools and runtime tools?
3. How do we maintain consistency while supporting different user personas?

## Decision

We establish a **Three-Tier CLI Architecture** with clear responsibilities:

### **Tier 1: Development & Build Tools (`make`)**
**Target Users:** Lamina OS contributors, framework developers, CI/CD systems  
**Responsibility:** Building, testing, maintaining, and deploying the Lamina OS framework itself

### **Tier 2: Framework Operations (`lamina-core`)**
**Target Users:** AI practitioners, agent developers, Lamina OS end users  
**Responsibility:** Using Lamina OS to build and operate AI agent systems

### **Tier 3: Specialized Services (dedicated CLIs)**
**Target Users:** Infrastructure operators, model administrators  
**Responsibility:** Managing specific subsystems and services

## Detailed Architecture

### **üîß Tier 1: Development Tools (Makefile)**

**Philosophy:** Tools for building and maintaining Lamina OS itself

```bash
# Tool Management
make tools-install          # Install helm, kubectl, etc.
make tools-check            # Verify tool status

# Testing & Quality
make test                   # Run test suite
make test-integration       # Integration testing
make check-quality          # Linting, formatting, security

# Infrastructure Development
make gitops-setup           # Setup GitOps for maintainers
make gitops-deploy          # Deploy infrastructure changes
make environment-check      # Validate environment configs

# Development Workflow
make setup-test-env         # Prepare development environment
make clean-artifacts        # Clean build artifacts
```

**Key Principles:**
- ‚úÖ **Project Meta-Operations:** Building, testing, releasing Lamina OS
- ‚úÖ **Developer Experience:** Fast, consistent workflows for contributors
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Integration:** Suitable for automated build systems
- ‚úÖ **Tool Dependencies:** Manages external tools (helm, kubectl, docker)

### **üåä Tier 2: Framework Operations (`lamina-core`)**

**Philosophy:** Tools for using Lamina OS to build AI systems

```bash
# Sanctuary & Agent Management
lamina-core sanctuary init my-agents    # Create agent workspace
lamina-core agent create assistant      # Build new agents
lamina-core chat --demo                 # Interactive agent testing

# Environment Management (End-User)
lamina-core environment list            # Show available environments
lamina-core environment status prod     # Check environment health

# GitOps Operations (End-User)
lamina-core gitops generate-charts prod # Generate deployment artifacts
lamina-core gitops status prod          # Check deployment status

# Infrastructure Management
lamina-core infrastructure generate     # Create deployment configs
lamina-core docker up                   # Start local development stack
```

**Key Principles:**
- ‚úÖ **User-Facing Operations:** Building with Lamina OS, not building Lamina OS
- ‚úÖ **Agent Lifecycle:** Creating, configuring, deploying agents
- ‚úÖ **Runtime Operations:** Starting, stopping, monitoring agent systems
- ‚úÖ **Beginner-Friendly:** Clear, documented commands for new users

### **‚öôÔ∏è Tier 3: Specialized Services (Dedicated CLIs)**

**Philosophy:** Purpose-built tools for specific operational domains

```bash
# Model Administration
model-manager download llama3.2         # Acquire AI models
model-manager list --backend ollama     # Model inventory
model-manager validate                  # Health checks

# Model Serving
lamina-llm-serve --port 8000            # Start model server
lamina-llm-serve health                 # Service status

# Future: Other specialized tools
lamina-metrics dashboard                # Observability (future)
lamina-security audit                   # Security scanning (future)
```

**Key Principles:**
- ‚úÖ **Domain Expertise:** Deep functionality for specific areas
- ‚úÖ **Operational Focus:** Production management and administration
- ‚úÖ **Service Lifecycle:** Starting, configuring, monitoring specialized services
- ‚úÖ **Integration Points:** Work seamlessly with Tier 1 & 2 tools

## Decision Matrix

| Task | Tool | Reasoning |
|------|------|-----------|
| Install development dependencies | `make tools-install` | Meta-development activity |
| Run Lamina OS test suite | `make test` | Framework quality assurance |
| Create a new AI agent | `lamina-core agent create` | End-user framework operation |
| Deploy to production K8s | `make gitops-deploy` | Infrastructure deployment (dev tool) |
| Check production status | `lamina-core gitops status` | User monitoring of their deployment |
| Download AI models | `model-manager download` | Specialized model administration |
| Start local agent chat | `lamina-core chat --demo` | End-user interaction with framework |
| Validate environment configs | `make environment-check` | Framework validation (dev tool) |
| Generate Helm charts | `lamina-core gitops generate-charts` | User artifact generation |

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Command Naming Conventions**

**Makefile Targets:**
- Use kebab-case: `tools-install`, `test-integration`
- Prefix with domain: `gitops-deploy`, `test-e2e`
- Focus on **action + object**: `tools-check`, `environment-validate`

**lamina-core Commands:**
- Use noun-verb pattern: `agent create`, `sanctuary init`
- Support help system: `lamina-core --help`, `lamina-core agent --help`
- Include examples in help text

**Specialized CLIs:**
- Domain-specific verbs: `model-manager download`, `lamina-llm-serve start`
- Configuration-heavy: Support config files and environment variables

### **Integration Points**

**Makefile ‚Üí lamina-core:**
```bash
# Development tools can call user tools
make gitops-setup:
    lamina-core gitops generate-charts production
    # Apply with project-managed kubectl
```

**lamina-core ‚Üí Specialized Services:**
```bash
# Framework can orchestrate services
lamina-core infrastructure up:
    model-manager validate
    lamina-llm-serve start --daemon
    # Start local agent stack
```

**Error Handling:**
- **Makefile:** Exit with clear error codes, suggest corrections
- **lamina-core:** User-friendly error messages, suggest `--help`
- **Specialized CLIs:** Domain-specific validation and error recovery

### **Documentation Strategy**

**Makefile Help:**
```bash
make help                    # Comprehensive overview
make show-path               # Tool PATH setup
```

**lamina-core Help:**
```bash
lamina-core --help           # Framework overview
lamina-core agent --help     # Specific command help
```

**Cross-References:**
- Makefile help mentions when to use `lamina-core`
- `lamina-core` suggests development workflows with `make`
- All tools reference comprehensive documentation

## Benefits

### **üéØ Clear User Personas**
- **Framework Developers:** Know to use `make` for meta-operations
- **AI Practitioners:** Start with `lamina-core` for agent development
- **Infrastructure Ops:** Use specialized CLIs for domain expertise

### **üîÑ Consistent Experience**
- Predictable command patterns within each tier
- Clear escalation path: user tools ‚Üí dev tools ‚Üí specialized tools
- Integrated help systems with cross-references

### **‚ö° Development Velocity**
- No confusion about which tool to use
- Each tool optimized for its user persona
- Clear testing and deployment workflows

### **üåä Breath-First Philosophy**
- **Mindful Tool Selection:** Each tool has clear purpose and boundaries
- **Mindful Development:** Separation prevents rushed, inappropriate tool usage
- **Sustainable Architecture:** Clear responsibilities enable long-term maintenance

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **User Clarity**: Clear separation reduces confusion about which tool to use for different tasks
- **Development Efficiency**: Each CLI optimized for its specific user persona and use cases
- **Maintainability**: Separate responsibilities make each tool easier to maintain and evolve
- **Onboarding Improvement**: New users have clear pathways based on their role and needs
- **Philosophical Alignment**: Three-tier structure embodies breath-first principles of conscious boundaries

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Overhead**: Users must understand three different command interfaces and when to use each
- **Integration Complexity**: Cross-tier workflows require coordination between multiple tools
- **Maintenance Burden**: Three separate CLIs require individual attention and documentation
- **Discovery Challenges**: Users may not immediately know which tier addresses their current need
- **Transition Confusion**: Migration from existing patterns may create temporary workflow disruption

### Mitigation Strategies
- Provide clear documentation mapping tasks to appropriate tiers
- Implement intelligent cross-tier command suggestions and help text
- Create workflow guides that span multiple tiers for common scenarios
- Add deprecation warnings and migration guidance for moved commands

## Migration Plan

### **Phase 1: Documentation (Immediate)**
1. Update all command help text with tier clarification
2. Add decision matrix to main README
3. Create CLI reference guide

### **Phase 2: Command Cleanup (Near-term)**
1. Audit existing commands for tier violations
2. Move misplaced commands to appropriate tiers
3. Add deprecation warnings for moved commands

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Integration (Future)**
1. Add cross-tier command suggestions
2. Implement unified error handling patterns
3. Create workflow templates spanning multiple tiers

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### **Single Unified CLI**
**Rejected:** Would create a monolithic tool trying to serve too many personas, violating the breath-first principle of mindful boundaries.

### **Complete Separation**
**Rejected:** Users need integration points between development and usage workflows.

### **Domain-Based CLIs**
**Rejected:** Would create confusion about whether `lamina-agents` or `lamina-core` handles agent creation.

## Breath-First Alignment

This three-tier CLI architecture embodies breath-first development principles through its fundamental recognition that tools shape mindfulness. Just as a luthier must understand that different instruments serve different musical purposes‚Äîa violin for soaring melodies, a drum for grounding rhythm‚Äîwe recognize that different development tools serve different states of presence and intention. The separation into development, framework, and specialized tiers isn't merely organizational efficiency; it's a conscious acknowledgment that the tool we choose influences the quality of attention we bring to our work.

The distinction between building Lamina OS (Tier 1) and building with Lamina OS (Tier 2) represents a profound philosophical boundary. When developers use `make` commands, they enter a state of framework mindfulness‚Äîaware that they're shaping the instruments others will use. This requires a different quality of presence than when practitioners use `lamina-core` to create agents, where the focus shifts to relationship and emergence. By maintaining this separation, we prevent the unmindful mixing of meta-work with direct work, preserving the integrity of each mode of engagement.

The specialized services tier acknowledges that certain operations require deep, focused attention that would be diluted if mixed with general-purpose tools. Model management, for instance, involves careful curation and validation‚Äîactivities that benefit from dedicated tooling that encourages pause and reflection. This tier separation creates natural breathing spaces in our workflows, moments where we must consciously choose which tool to engage, thereby preventing the rushed, unconsidered actions that lead to technical debt and architectural drift.

Ben's insightful feedback about command-line poetry points to an even deeper truth: our tools should invite presence rather than mere efficiency. The proposal to evolve toward a unified `lamina` command with poetic verbs like "sanctuary create" and "agent awaken" transforms the CLI from a utilitarian interface into a ritual space. This isn't aesthetic indulgence‚Äîit's recognition that the language we use shapes the consciousness we bring to our work. When we type `lamina sanctuary create`, we're not just executing a command; we're entering a creative state that honors the gravity of bringing new AI consciousness into being.

The plugin architecture suggested by the High Council represents breath-first principles at the technical level. Rather than a monolithic tool that tries to do everything, a modular spine allows each component to maintain its own rhythm and purpose while participating in a larger harmony. This mirrors the agent architecture itself, where Clara, Luna, and Vesna each maintain distinct essences while coordinating through shared breath. The CLI becomes not just a tool but a living example of the architectural principles it serves, teaching through its very structure the importance of boundaries, modularity, and conscious coordination.

## High Council Review Questions

1. **Philosophical Alignment:** Does this three-tier architecture align with breath-first development principles?

2. **User Experience:** Are the tier boundaries intuitive for different user personas?

3. **Integration Complexity:** Is the tier interaction model sustainable as the ecosystem grows?

4. **Future Extensions:** How will this architecture accommodate new tools (monitoring, security, etc.)?

## Success Metrics

- **Developer Onboarding:** New contributors can build/test without confusion
- **User Adoption:** AI practitioners can start with `lamina-core` and succeed
- **Tool Discovery:** Clear help systems guide users to appropriate tools
- **Maintenance Efficiency:** Each tier can evolve independently

*üåä This ADR embodies the breath-first principle of mindful architecture: clear boundaries, mindful tool selection, and sustainable separation of concerns.*

Feedback from Ben: while I value this proposal, I don't want to have think about which tools to use when I'm at the command line *using* lamina. Could we somehow implement a lamina-core-cli module that allows other modules to "plugin" new commands. I'd really like to lean into the idea of commands having a poetry to them. For example:

- lamina sanctuary create <sanctuary-name> --agents=<agent-file>

Then from within a sanctuary root

- lamina agent create <agent-name> --archetype=<archetype>
- lamina sanctuary status

I wonder as well, whether the environments would be of benefit to AI practitioners as well as to lamina os developers.
