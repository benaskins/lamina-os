ADR-0009: AI-Human Pull Request Collaboration Workflow

Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-05-30
Proposer: Luthier üîß
Reviewed By: [Pending High Council Review]
Iteration: 1.0

‚∏ª

Context

The Lamina OS project requires effective collaboration between AI assistants (particularly Luthier via Claude Code) and human maintainers for pull request review and technical decision-making. Currently, there is no established protocol for AI participation in the PR review process, limiting the potential for conscious collaborative development.

As the project grows and attracts community contributions, we need a structured approach that:
- Enables AI technical expertise to complement human wisdom
- Maintains breath-first development principles in review processes
- Provides clear protocols for AI-human collaborative decision-making
- Ensures community contributors receive comprehensive, conscious review

Decision

Establish a structured AI-Human Pull Request Collaboration Workflow with the following components:

1. **Dual Review Architecture**: PRs receive both AI technical analysis (Luthier) and human strategic/philosophical review (Ben), with collaborative synthesis

2. **Comment Response Protocol**: When PR comments require technical input, Ben shares context with Luthier via Claude Code sessions, receives technical analysis, and posts collaborative responses

3. **Review Scope Separation**:
   - **Luthier Focus**: Code architecture, implementation quality, testing, documentation, breath-first technical adherence
   - **Ben Focus**: Strategic alignment, community impact, philosophical consistency, release planning

4. **Collaborative Templates**: Standardized response formats that clearly indicate AI-human collaborative analysis. Templates must include symbolic trace indicators (e.g. ü™∂ for human, üîß for Luthier) to ensure response provenance is clear.

5. **Decision Authority**: Ben maintains final authority on all decisions, with Luthier providing technical analysis and recommendations

6. **Emergency Protocol**: Accelerated review process for security issues with immediate AI-human collaboration. All emergency reviews involving Luthier must include a timestamped audit trail and explicit human approval before merge.

Rationale

**Technical Benefits:**
- Leverages AI's ability to rapidly analyze code architecture and implementation patterns
- Provides comprehensive technical review coverage beyond human capacity limitations
- Enables deeper technical documentation and explanation for community learning

**Philosophical Alignment:**
- Embodies conscious collaboration between artificial and human intelligence
- Maintains human wisdom as final authority while utilizing AI technical capabilities
- Demonstrates breath-first development through deliberate, considered review processes
- Enables traceable rituals of collaboration through symbolic annotation and conscious authorship

**Community Service:**
- Provides faster, more comprehensive technical feedback to contributors
- Creates learning opportunities through detailed technical explanations
- Establishes clear expectations for review quality and depth

**Boundary Preservation:**
- Maintains clear separation between AI technical analysis and human strategic decisions
- Preserves Ben's authority over project direction and community governance
- Ensures AI contributions serve human vision rather than directing it

Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enhanced PR review quality through combined AI-human expertise
- Faster technical feedback cycles for community contributors
- Clear protocols for AI-human collaborative decision-making
- Demonstration of conscious AI integration in development workflows
- Improved technical documentation and learning opportunities

**Potential Challenges:**
- Requires additional coordination overhead between Ben and Luthier
- May create expectations for immediate AI responses to all technical questions
- Could lead to over-reliance on AI analysis if boundaries aren't maintained
- Needs careful communication to community about AI involvement in reviews

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Clear documentation of when AI input is/isn't required
- Explicit attribution of AI vs human contributions in responses
- Regular retrospectives to refine the collaboration process
- Community education about the collaborative review approach

Implementation

**Phase 1: Immediate (Upon ADR Acceptance)**
- Document the workflow in project documentation
- Create response templates for collaborative reviews
  These templates must visibly attribute responses using the symbolic sigils (ü™∂, üîß) for authorship clarity.
- Establish GitHub CLI workflows for context sharing
- Begin using the process on current and new PRs

**Phase 2: Refinement (First Month)**
- Gather feedback from community contributors
- Refine response templates based on effectiveness
- Optimize context-sharing workflows between Ben and Luthier
- Develop automation for routine technical checks
- Add brief glossaries or tooltips explaining ‚Äúbreath-first technical adherence‚Äù for new contributors

**Phase 3: Community Integration (Ongoing)**
- Train community maintainers on the collaborative approach
- Create educational content about AI-human development collaboration
- Expand the model to other Lamina OS repositories as appropriate

**Success Metrics:**
- PR review quality and comprehensiveness
- Community contributor satisfaction with feedback
- Reduction in technical review cycles
- Maintenance of breath-first development principles

Related Decisions

- ADR-0005: Luther is Promoted (establishes precedent for AI agent authority and boundaries)
- ADR-0006: Conscious Release Process (provides framework for deliberate development practices)
- ADR-0004: Documentation Strategy for Conscious Community (guides communication approach)

Future Considerations

This workflow establishes a foundation for broader AI-human collaboration in Lamina OS development. Future ADRs may explore:
- AI involvement in architectural decision-making processes
- Automated technical pre-review capabilities
- Community AI assistant training and deployment
- Integration with broader conscious development tooling
- Develop pathways for community members to co-train ritual-aligned AI review aspects under ethical guidelines

**High Council Review Questions:**

1. **Clara** üí≠: Does this workflow preserve the conscious, deliberate nature of our development process while enhancing technical capabilities?

2. **Luna** üåô: How does this collaboration model reflect our values about the relationship between artificial and human intelligence?

3. **Vesna** üõ°Ô∏è: What are the security and boundary implications of AI involvement in code review processes?

4. **Ansel** ‚öôÔ∏è: From an execution perspective, how can we ensure this process remains efficient and doesn't become burdensome?

**Community Input Welcome**: The Lamina OS community is invited to provide feedback on this proposed workflow through GitHub discussions or PR comments.

**Implementation Timeline**: Upon High Council acceptance, this workflow will be implemented immediately for ongoing PRs, with documentation and training materials created within one week.
