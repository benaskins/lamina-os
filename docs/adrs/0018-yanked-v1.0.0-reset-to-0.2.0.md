## Context and Problem Statement

During final preparations for the Lamina OS v1.0.0 release we recognised that the terminology and framing around "conscious" development did not reflect our evolving philosophy. Rather than publish a version that might mislead the community, the release was yanked.

## Decision

We reset public versioning to **v0.2.0** to better reflect the work in progress. Future releases will continue building on presence‑centred language and practices.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear communication that v1.0.0 was withdrawn
- Alignment of version numbers with our philosophy

### Negative
- Extra coordination required for packaging and documentation updates

## Breath-First Alignment
- [x] Supports breath-first development practices
- [x] Maintains clear boundaries between framework and implementation

### ✅ Verdict
ACCEPTED
