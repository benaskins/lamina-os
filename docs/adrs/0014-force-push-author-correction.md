# ADR-0014: Retrospective - Force Push for Author Email Correction

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-01-31  
**Type:** Retrospective  
**Authors:** Luthier  
**Authorized By:** Ben Askins  

## Context

Git history contained commits with author email `baskins@squareup.com` from work-related git configuration. This created inappropriate attribution linking personal open-source contributions to employer email.

## Decision

Executed authorized force push to rewrite git history, changing all instances of `baskins@squareup.com` to `ben.askins@gmail.com`.

## Implementation

1. Created backup branch before rewriting
2. Used `git filter-branch` to correct author emails
3. Force pushed to main and feature branches with explicit authorization
4. Cleaned up temporary branches

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Clear separation between personal and work contributions
- **Positive:** Proper attribution for open-source work
- **Negative:** One-time history rewrite requiring downstream users to re-clone

## Breath-First Alignment

This seemingly technical correction embodies several deep breath-first principles. At its heart, this decision recognizes that identity and attribution are not mere metadata but fundamental aspects of conscious development. The mixing of personal and professional email addresses represents more than a configuration error—it's a blurring of boundaries that compromises the integrity of the work. By taking the time to correct this attribution, we honor the principle that conscious development requires clear boundaries and authentic identity.

The decision to use force push, typically considered a dangerous operation, demonstrates the breath-first principle of accepting responsibility for necessary disruption. Rather than allowing the incorrect attribution to persist indefinitely, we chose a moment of conscious intervention. This required pause, consideration of consequences, and explicit authorization—a breathing rhythm of reflection before action. The creation of backup branches before rewriting shows respect for history even as we correct it, acknowledging that transformation should be undertaken with care.

The documentation of this decision as a retrospective ADR reveals another breath-first principle: transparency in our imperfections. We don't hide the fact that a correction was needed, nor do we pretend that our development process is without mistakes. Instead, we breathe with the reality of human error and document our response to it. This creates a learning artifact for the community, showing that conscious development includes conscious correction when alignment has been lost.

Most profoundly, this correction honors the relationship between creator and creation. Ben's open-source contributions to Lamina OS are acts of creative offering, distinct from employment obligations. By ensuring proper attribution, we maintain the sacred boundary between work done for compensation and work done for community. This separation isn't about legal technicalities but about preserving the different qualities of intention that flow into different kinds of creation.

## Authorization

This force push was explicitly authorized by repository owner Ben Askins on 2025-01-31 to correct attribution issues.
