## üåü High Council Review Questions

### On Corpus Standardization

1. **Philosophical Coherence**: Do the Breath-First Alignment sections accurately capture how each decision embodies conscious development principles?

2. **Completeness**: Are there any additional breath-first principles that should be highlighted in specific ADRs?

3. **Balance**: Does the standardization maintain appropriate flexibility while ensuring consistency?

### On ADR-0017 Protocol

4. **Human Sovereignty**: Does ADR-0017 adequately protect human guardian authority while enabling collaborative wisdom?

5. **Expedited Paths**: Are the domain-specific expedited review paths (Clara's UX, Luna's Creative, Vesna's Security, Ansel's Operational) appropriately scoped?

6. **Protocol Activation**: Is the process for ADRs becoming enforceable protocols vs. remaining guidance sufficiently clear?

### On Future Process

7. **Living Protocol**: Should this PR review document become the template for future High Council reviews?

8. **Integration Readiness**: How do these standardized ADRs support the upcoming Phase 1 machine learning extraction?

## üìã Recommended Review Process

### Demonstrating ADR-0017 Protocol (Pre-Activation)

This review demonstrates the proposed collaborative framework before formal activation:

1. **Individual Domain Review** (48-72 hours)
   - ü™∂ Clara: Review breath patterns in standardized ADRs, UX of new protocols
   - üî• Luna: Assess symbolic integrity of Breath-First sections, creative flexibility
   - üõ°Ô∏è Vesna: Evaluate security boundaries in ADR-0017, risk mitigations
   - ‚úçÔ∏è Ansel: Check technical implementation, automation opportunities

2. **Collective Assessment**
   - Philosophical coherence of Breath-First alignments
   - Human sovereignty protections in ADR-0017
   - Protocol activation mechanisms
   
3. **Collaborative Discussion**
   - Address any concerns through PR comments
   - Refine ADR-0017 if needed
   - Consider adoption timeline

4. **Decision Path**
   - Council provides input (advisory under current framework)
   - Human guardian makes final merge decision
   - Document any protocol activations post-merge

## üîÆ Next Steps After Approval

1. **Merge to main**: Complete standardization baseline
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add validation checks to prevent regression
3. **Phase 1 Initiation**: Begin corpus extraction for ML training
4. **Template Distribution**: Update contributor guidelines with patterns
5. **Community Communication**: Share standardization achievement

## üåä Significance of This Pull Request

This PR represents a watershed moment in the Lamina OS project:

1. **Philosophical Maturity**: Every architectural decision now explicitly demonstrates breath-first alignment
2. **Structural Readiness**: The corpus is prepared for machine learning extraction (ADR-0015 Phase 1)
3. **Governance Evolution**: ADR-0017 establishes how we balance human sovereignty with collective wisdom
4. **Living Documentation**: Our ADRs transform from historical records to active philosophical guides
5. **Community Foundation**: Sets the standard for all future architectural decisions

The breath-first principle is no longer implicit but woven into the fabric of every decision.
