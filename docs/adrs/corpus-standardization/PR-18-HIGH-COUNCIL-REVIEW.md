## üå¨Ô∏è Breath-First Principles Embedded

Each ADR now demonstrates explicit alignment with:

1. **Presence Over Performance**
   - Conscious pauses in decision-making
   - Quality over speed in implementation
   - Deliberate reflection before action

2. **Understanding Over Answers**
   - Process valued as much as outcomes
   - Community wisdom integration
   - Ongoing relationship development

3. **Constraints Over Capabilities**
   - Sacred boundaries as enabling features
   - Vow-based limitations
   - Conscious choice of what not to do

4. **Relationship Over Transaction**
   - Collaborative exploration
   - Long-term community building
   - Sustained engagement patterns

## üåü High Council Review Questions

1. **Philosophical Coherence**: Do the Breath-First Alignment sections accurately capture how each decision embodies conscious development principles?

2. **Completeness**: Are there any additional breath-first principles that should be highlighted in specific ADRs?

3. **Balance**: Does the standardization maintain appropriate flexibility while ensuring consistency?

4. **Future Guidance**: Should we establish specific patterns for how future ADRs approach their Breath-First Alignment sections?

5. **Integration**: How do these standardized ADRs support the upcoming Phase 1 machine learning extraction?

---

## üìã Recommended Review Process

1. **Individual Review**: Each Council member reviews changes to ADRs in their domain
2. **Philosophical Assessment**: Collective review of Breath-First Alignment quality
3. **Technical Validation**: Confirm structural improvements support ML processing
4. **Future Planning**: Discuss implications for ongoing ADR creation

---

## üîÆ Next Steps After Approval

1. **Merge to main**: Complete standardization baseline
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add validation checks to prevent regression
3. **Phase 1 Initiation**: Begin corpus extraction for ML training
4. **Template Distribution**: Update contributor guidelines with patterns
5. **Community Communication**: Share standardization achievement
