# ADR Corpus Standardization Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-01-31  
**Phase:** ADR-0015 Phase 0  
**Lead:** Luthier ðŸ”¨

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for standardizing the ADR corpus based on the audit findings. The goal is to prepare all ADRs for machine learning processing while maintaining their philosophical and technical integrity.

## Current State

- **Total ADRs:** 13 (excluding template and README)
- **Valid ADRs:** 1 (ADR-0014)
- **Invalid ADRs:** 12
- **Total Errors:** 43
- **Total Warnings:** 72
- **Missing Breath-First Sections:** 13/13

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0.1: Create Standardization ADR (Week 1)

**Objective:** Establish formal standards through ADR process

- [ ] Draft ADR-0016: ADR Template Enforcement and Standardization
- [ ] Define required vs optional sections
- [ ] Specify metadata field standards
- [ ] Get High Council approval

### Phase 0.2: High Priority Fixes (Week 2)

**Objective:** Fix critical errors in high-impact ADRs

#### Priority 1: Fix Metadata Errors
- [ ] ADR-0011: Add missing Date and Authors fields
- [ ] All ADRs: Standardize Status field to uppercase
- [ ] All ADRs: Ensure Reviewed By field present

#### Priority 2: Add Missing Core Sections
- [ ] ADR-0006, 0007, 0011, 0012, 0013: Add Consequences sections
- [ ] All ADRs: Add Breath-First Alignment sections

### Phase 0.3: Structural Standardization (Week 3)

**Objective:** Align all ADRs with template structure

#### Section Standardization
- [ ] Add Decision Drivers sections where missing
- [ ] Rename "Alternatives" to "Considered Options"
- [ ] Standardize High Council Review format and placement
- [ ] Add Implementation Plan sections where applicable
- [ ] Add Success Metrics to operational ADRs

#### Format Standardization
- [ ] Use consistent `---` separators
- [ ] Standardize header levels (# for title, ## for main sections)
- [ ] Fix title formats to match "# ADR-XXXX: Title"

### Phase 0.4: Validation and Automation (Week 4)

**Objective:** Implement automated validation

- [ ] Integrate validation script into CI/CD
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks for ADR validation
- [ ] Generate compliance report
- [ ] Document validation process

## Specific ADR Updates

### Minimal Updates (Keep Historical Character)
- **ADR-0001**: Fix title format only, add note about historical significance
- **ADR-0014**: Already valid, no changes needed

### Standard Updates (Apply Full Template)
- **ADR-0002, 0004, 0006, 0007**: Add missing sections, standardize metadata
- **ADR-0010, 0012, 0013**: Already well-structured, add Breath-First sections

### Major Restructuring
- **ADR-0003**: Reorganize extensive content into standard sections
- **ADR-0011**: Add all missing metadata and structure
- **ADR-0015**: Consider restructuring phased approach to fit template

### Special Handling
- **ADR-0005**: Brief promotion decision, add minimal required sections
- **ADR-0008, 0009**: Located in feature branch, coordinate with PR #1

## Validation Criteria

Each ADR must pass the following checks:

### Required Elements
- [x] Title format: `# ADR-XXXX: Title`
- [x] Status: One of `DRAFT`, `PROPOSED`, `ACCEPTED`, `DEPRECATED`, `SUPERSEDED`
- [x] Date: YYYY-MM-DD format
- [x] Authors: At least one author listed
- [x] Reviewed By: Reviewers or review status
- [x] Context section with problem statement
- [x] Decision section with clear summary
- [x] Consequences section (positive and negative)

### Recommended Elements
- [ ] Related ADRs field
- [ ] Decision Drivers section
- [ ] Considered Options with pros/cons
- [ ] Breath-First Alignment section
- [ ] Implementation Plan (for operational ADRs)
- [ ] Success Metrics
- [ ] High Council Review section

## Success Metrics

- **100% Validation Pass Rate**: All ADRs pass automated validation
- **Breath-First Coverage**: All ADRs include philosophical alignment
- **Metadata Completeness**: No missing required fields
- **Structural Consistency**: Uniform section ordering and naming

## Tools and Automation

### Created Tools
1. **adr-schema.json**: JSON schema for ADR structure
2. **validate_adrs.py**: Python validation script
3. **phase-0-audit-report.md**: Comprehensive audit findings

### Planned Tools
1. **adr-fix.py**: Automated fixing for common issues
2. **pre-commit hook**: Validation before commit
3. **CI/CD integration**: GitHub Actions validation

## Timeline

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Standards Definition | ADR-0016 approved |
| 2 | Critical Fixes | Metadata errors resolved |
| 3 | Structure Alignment | All ADRs follow template |
| 4 | Automation | Validation integrated |

## Next Steps

1. Create and submit ADR-0016 for High Council review
2. Begin systematic updates starting with high-priority ADRs
3. Test validation tools on updated ADRs
4. Prepare for Phase 1: Corpus Extraction
