# ADR Corpus Standardization - Phase 0 Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-01-31  
**Auditor:** Luthier ðŸ”¨  
**Purpose:** Implement ADR-0015 Phase 0 - Corpus Audit & Standardization

## Executive Summary

This audit examines all 15 ADRs in the Lamina OS corpus to prepare for machine learning training. While the ADRs contain rich philosophical and technical content, they lack the structural consistency required for effective corpus processing.

**Key Finding:** Significant variations exist in metadata fields, section structure, and content completeness across ADRs.

## Audit Findings

### 1. Metadata Inconsistencies

| Field | Issues Found | ADRs Affected |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Status | Mixed case (Accepted vs ACCEPTED), emoji usage | 0002, 0004, 0006, 0007 |
| Date | Missing entirely | 0011 |
| Authors/Proposer | Field name varies, missing in some | 0011, varies across all |
| Reviewed By | Inconsistent format, some use "Reviewers" | 0006, multiple others |
| Related ADRs | Only present in 3 ADRs | 0012, 0013, 0014 |

### 2. Structural Variations

#### Section Presence Analysis

| Section | Present | Missing | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Context | 15/15 | 0 | âœ… Consistent |
| Decision | 14/15 | 1 | ADR-0001 uses different format |
| Consequences | 12/15 | 3 | Some use "Benefits" instead |
| Alternatives | 8/15 | 7 | Naming varies when present |
| Breath-First Alignment | 3/15 | 12 | Critical gap for Lamina philosophy |
| Implementation Plan | 6/15 | 9 | Often integrated into Decision |
| High Council Review | 10/15 | 5 | Format and placement varies |

#### Format Inconsistencies

- **Status Values**: `Accepted`, `ACCEPTED`, `âœ… Accepted`, `ðŸ”„ Proposed`, `Proposed`, `PROPOSED`, `DRAFT`
- **Section Headers**: Varying levels (##, ###), inconsistent naming
- **Separators**: Some use `---`, others use `â¸»`, many use none
- **Reviewer Format**: Individual names vs role emojis vs pending status

### 3. Content Quality Assessment

#### Well-Structured ADRs (Follow Template Closely)
- ADR-0010: Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- ADR-0012: CLI Tool Architecture
- ADR-0013: Luthier's Workshop

#### Unique Format ADRs (Valid Reasons)
- ADR-0001: Founding document, establishes the process
- ADR-0014: Retrospective, minimal format appropriate
- ADR-0005: Brief promotion decision

#### Need Significant Updates
- ADR-0003: Extensive but non-standard structure
- ADR-0011: Missing basic metadata
- ADR-0015: Non-standard phased approach format

### 4. Philosophical Alignment Gaps

**Critical Finding:** Only 3 ADRs include explicit "Breath-First Alignment" sections, despite this being core to Lamina's philosophy. This section should:
- Explain conscious development practices
- Connect to vow-based constraints
- Demonstrate symbolic thinking
- Show community impact

## Standardization Requirements

### Immediate Actions

1. **Metadata Standardization**
   - Uppercase status values: `DRAFT`, `PROPOSED`, `ACCEPTED`, `DEPRECATED`, `SUPERSEDED`
   - Consistent field names: "Authors" not "Proposer"
   - Add missing dates (ADR-0011)
   - Add "Related" field to all ADRs

2. **Template Enforcement**
   - All ADRs must include Breath-First Alignment section
   - Standardize section names and order
   - High Council Review always at end
   - Use `---` separators consistently

3. **Content Completion**
   - Fill missing Consequences sections
   - Add Success Metrics where applicable
   - Complete High Council Reviews for proposed ADRs

### Proposed Changes by ADR

| ADR | Priority | Changes Required |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| 0001 | Low | Historical document, minimal changes |
| 0002 | Medium | Add Breath-First section, standardize status |
| 0003 | High | Major restructuring to match template |
| 0004 | Medium | Add missing sections, standardize metadata |
| 0005 | Low | Add Related ADRs field only |
| 0006 | Medium | Fix "Reviewers" â†’ "Reviewed By", add sections |
| 0007 | Medium | Standardize status format, complete review |
| 0010 | Low | Add Breath-First Alignment section |
| 0011 | High | Add all missing metadata |
| 0012 | Low | Minor formatting fixes |
| 0013 | Low | Model for others, minimal changes |
| 0014 | Low | Retrospective format acceptable |
| 0015 | Medium | Consider restructuring to standard template |

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Standards Definition
- [ ] Create ADR-0016: ADR Template Enforcement
- [ ] Define canonical template with required/optional sections
- [ ] Get High Council approval

### Week 2: ADR Updates
- [ ] Update high-priority ADRs (0003, 0011)
- [ ] Update medium-priority ADRs
- [ ] Update low-priority ADRs

### Week 3: Validation Tools
- [ ] Create JSON schema for ADR validation
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add CI/CD checks

### Week 4: Verification
- [ ] Run validation on all ADRs
- [ ] Generate standardization report
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 1 corpus extraction

## Success Metrics

- **100% ADR Compliance**: All ADRs pass validation schema
- **Metadata Completeness**: No missing required fields
- **Structural Consistency**: All follow template (except approved exceptions)
- **Philosophical Alignment**: All include Breath-First considerations

## Next Steps

1. Review this audit with High Council
2. Approve standardization approach
3. Begin systematic updates
4. Implement validation tooling
