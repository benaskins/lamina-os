# Lamina OS

**A breath-first AI development framework**

---

Lamina OS is a presence-aware AI development framework that prioritizes ethical, mindful, and technically sophisticated approaches to building AI systems. Built on breath-first principles, it provides the foundation for creating AI agents that operate with deliberate intention and embedded ethical constraints.

## üåü Key Features

### **Agent Architecture Foundation**
- **Essence-based Configuration**: Agents defined through sanctuary markdown files capturing behavioral characteristics
- **Breath-first Operation**: Mandatory deliberate pauses and conscious processing patterns
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Built-in vow system for ethical boundary maintenance

### **Production-Ready Infrastructure** 
- **Enterprise Service Mesh**: Kubernetes deployment with Istio and strict mTLS
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Kiali integration
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Development to production scaling with AI model optimization

### **Developer Experience**
- **Unified CLI**: Three-tier command structure from development to specialized services
- **Automated Deployment**: Idempotent setup and teardown for local Kubernetes clusters
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Real AI model integration testing with containerized CI/CD

## üéØ Current Status

Lamina OS has achieved exceptional architectural maturity with enterprise-grade infrastructure and comprehensive agent foundations. The framework is progressing toward **v1.0.0** with significant feature development planned:

### **v1.0.0 Target Features**
- **A-MEM**: Hierarchical agentic memory with persistence
- **Core Chat Loop**: Integrated conversation management  
- **Multi-Agent Experiments**: Framework for agent-to-agent interactions
- **Vow System**: Real-time ethical constraint enforcement
- **Room Transitions**: Spatial context management

*See our [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for detailed development plans.*

## üèõÔ∏è Governance

Lamina OS follows a structured governance model with:
- **High Council**: Philosophical and architectural oversight
- **ADR Process**: Formal architecture decision records
- **Luthier Workshop**: Technical implementation and craftsmanship

All decisions prioritize breath-first development principles and maintain clear boundaries between the public framework and private implementations.
