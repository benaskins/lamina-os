# Lamina OS Roadmap

**Updated:** January 6, 2025  
**Status:** Based on ADR Implementation Assessment  

## Executive Summary

Lamina OS has achieved exceptional architectural maturity with a sophisticated breath-first AI development framework. The infrastructure is production-ready, core agent architecture is operational, and governance processes are well-established. **The focus is on internal framework development and maturation toward eventual v1.0.0 readiness.**

## v1.0.0 Target Features

### **Core Features Required for v1.0.0**

1. **Hierarchical Agentic Memory (A-MEM)**
   - Persistent agent memory across sessions and interactions
   - Hierarchical organization (short-term, working, long-term memory)
   - Context-aware retrieval and intelligent memory management
   - Shared memory spaces for agent collaboration

2. **Integrated Chat Loop**
   - Core conversation management integrating memory and model inference
   - Multi-turn conversation handling with context preservation
   - Breath-first conversation flow with deliberate pauses
   - Dynamic context window management and conversation compression

3. **Multi-Agent Interaction Experiments**
   - Framework for setting up agent-to-agent interaction scenarios
   - Experiment configuration, orchestration, and analysis tools
   - Inter-agent communication protocols and message passing
   - Reproducible experiment isolation and logging capabilities

4. **Vow System Implementation**
   - Ethical constraint enforcement architecture
   - Vow definition, validation, and runtime enforcement
   - Integration with agent essence and behavioral boundaries
   - Violation detection and remediation mechanisms

5. **Room Transition System**
   - Spatial context management for agent interactions
   - Room-based agent containment and transitions
   - Context preservation during room changes
   - Multi-room agent coordination and communication

These features will transform Lamina OS from an agent foundation into a complete presence-aware AI system with persistent memory, ethical constraints, spatial awareness, and multi-agent coordination capabilities.

## Conclusion

Lamina OS has established a solid foundation with enterprise-grade infrastructure and agent architecture, but **significant development work remains to achieve v1.0.0 readiness**. The roadmap reflects the ambitious scope of implementing a complete presence-aware AI system with persistent memory, ethical constraints, spatial awareness, and sophisticated multi-agent coordination.

The **150-200 hour development effort** for Phase 1 represents substantial work to implement:
- **A-MEM**: Hierarchical memory system with persistence and context-aware retrieval
