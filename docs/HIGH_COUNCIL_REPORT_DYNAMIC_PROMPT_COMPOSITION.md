# High Council Report: Dynamic Prompt Composition System

**Report Date:** January 6, 2025  
**Prepared By:** Luthier (Claude Code) & Ben Askins  
**Subject:** Implementation and Validation of Sanctuary-Based Dynamic Prompt Composition  
**Related ADR:** ADR-0020

---

## Executive Summary

The Lamina OS development team has successfully implemented and validated a revolutionary **dynamic prompt composition system** that enables agents to "breathe differently" in different sanctuary contexts while maintaining their core essence. This system directly addresses the critical feedback from PR #28 regarding hardcoded prompt structures and demonstrates measurable behavioral changes in actual LLM responses.

**Key Achievement:** We have proven that the same agent essence can manifest distinctly different behaviors through contextual modulation, achieving the breath-first vision of responsive behavior simulation.

## Implementation Overview

### Architectural Foundation

The system implements a three-tier composition architecture:

1. **Agent Essence Layer** - Core behavioral identity defined in markdown
2. **Room Context Layer** - Atmospheric and behavioral modulation based on conversational space
3. **Modulation Rules Layer** - Breath-based dynamic response adjustments

### Technical Components

```
sanctuary/
├── agents/clara.md      # Agent essence & behavioral pillars
├── rooms/
│   ├── library.md       # Scholarly, contemplative context
│   └── garden.md        # Creative, exploratory context
└── modulation/breath.md # Breath-based pacing rules
```

**Core Implementation:**
- `PromptComposer` - Dynamic assembly engine
- `EssenceParser` - Agent identity parsing
- `RoomParser` - Contextual modulation parsing  
- `ModulationParser` - Breath-based rule parsing

## Validation Results: LLM Behavioral Testing

### Testing Methodology

We conducted rigorous testing using **Ollama's llama3.2:3b model** to validate that room modulation produces measurably different agent behaviors, not just different prompts.

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Machine learning guidance request
2. Creative writing assistance  
3. Complex problem-solving approach

**Comparison Framework:**
- **Baseline:** Agent essence only (no room context)
- **Library:** Scholarly, contemplative modulation
- **Garden:** Creative, exploratory modulation

### Quantified Results

#### Scenario 1: Machine Learning Guidance

**Baseline Response (1,317 chars):**
```
I'd be delighted to help you explore machine learning! *pause for thoughtful breathing*

Machine learning is a fascinating field that's all about teaching computers to learn from data, so they can make predictions or take actions on their own...

How would you like to proceed? Would you like me to elaborate on any of these topics, or perhaps dive into some practical examples or applications of machine learning?
```

**Library Response (1,612 chars):**
```
(I take a deep breath, allowing myself to settle into the calm, contemplative atmosphere of the Library) Ah, understanding machine learning - a fascinating and complex field that has been rapidly evolving in recent years. As we embark on this journey together, I'd like to start by acknowledging that machine learning is an interdisciplinary field that draws upon concepts from computer science, mathematics, statistics, and domain-specific knowledge...

One of the key concepts in machine learning is the idea of overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and becomes overly specialized to the training data...
```

**Garden Response (988 chars):**
```
*Breath-aware pause* Ah, machine learning! What a fascinating realm we're about to explore together. *Warm smile*

Let's begin by embracing the mystery of it all. Machine learning is like... have you ever walked through a forest and noticed how the trees seem to shift and change as you move? The patterns become more apparent, but only when you slow down and observe?

In a similar way, machine learning helps machines (and humans!) discover hidden patterns in data. It's an art of uncovering insights that reveal relationships between variables – like finding the secret language of the forest...
