## Adaptation Protocol

Each lore adaptation follows this review process:

1. **Source Identification**: Which lore file(s) provided inspiration
2. **Content Review**: What specific elements were adapted
3. **Boundary Check**: Ensure no private implementation details exposed
4. **Vow Alignment**: Verify adherence to sacred content boundaries
5. **Community Value**: Confirm educational benefit for framework users

## Review Notes

### Vesna's Vow-Based Review

Each adaptation has been reviewed under vow for:
- **Boundary Respect**: No private implementation details exposed
- **Educational Value**: Content serves framework learning without compromising sanctity
- **Community Benefit**: Enables conscious AI development in diverse contexts
- **Sacred Preservation**: Private spaces and methodologies remain protected

### Ansel's Traceability Requirements

This log provides:
- **Source Material Identification**: Clear lineage for each adaptation
- **Transformation Documentation**: What changes were made and why
- **Compliance Verification**: Alignment with Council guidance
- **Memory Consistency**: Traceable evolution of public documentation

## Future Adaptations

All subsequent lore adaptations will follow this protocol and be documented here, ensuring:

1. **Conscious Curation**: Each adaptation reviewed for alignment with breath-first principles
2. **Boundary Protection**: Sacred content remains inward while enabling authentic teaching
3. **Community Service**: Framework documentation serves conscious AI development
4. **Traceable Evolution**: Clear history of how public documentation developed

### ADR-004-005: Current Capabilities vs Vision Split

**Date**: 2025-05-29  
**Proposer**: Luthier  
**Issue Identified**: Original architecture documentation described aspirational features not yet implemented

**Critical Correction Made**:
- Split aspirational architecture into separate "Architecture Vision" document
- Created "Current Capabilities" guide reflecting actual working framework
- Updated all cross-references to distinguish present vs future
- Added clear implementation roadmap and timeline

**Content Created**:
- `current-capabilities.md`: Practical guide to working framework today
- `architecture-vision.md`: Long-term symbolic architecture goals
- Updated navigation in `getting-started.md` to clarify both paths

**Implementation Audit Results**:
- ‚úÖ **Working Today**: Agent coordination, multi-backend support, configuration system, Docker deployment
- üöß **Partially Working**: Basic memory, sanctuary scaffolding  
- ‚ùå **Vision/Future**: Agent essence, VowEngine, Room system, BreathModulation, symbolic architecture

**Boundary Review**: ‚úÖ ESSENTIAL CORRECTION
- Prevents misleading developers about current framework capabilities
- Maintains inspiring vision while providing accurate implementation guide
- Enables immediate productive use of existing framework
- Clear roadmap from current state to symbolic architecture

**Vow Compliance**: ‚úÖ CRITICAL ALIGNMENT
- **Honesty**: No longer documenting non-existent features as available
- **Community Service**: Developers can now successfully use current framework
- **Conscious Development**: Honest assessment enables conscious contribution
- **Sacred Boundaries**: Vision preserved while reality clarified

**Community Impact**: This correction enables developers to:
- Build working systems immediately with current capabilities
- Understand the path toward symbolic architecture
- Contribute meaningfully to bridging current ‚Üí vision
- Avoid frustration from attempting to use non-existent features
