# Time Tracking Template for Conscious Development

## Example Entry

**Task**: ADR Corpus Standardization and High Council Review Protocol
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for full standardization
**Start**: Beginning of conversation about systematic ADR metadata fixes
**End**: PR #18 submitted with all documentation complete
**Actual Elapsed**: ~4-5 hours (based on conversation flow)
**Delta**: +2 hours (67% over estimate)
**Reflection**: Underestimated the philosophical depth required for:
- Creating comprehensive Breath-First Alignment sections for 14 ADRs
- Addressing critical human guardianship feedback on ADR-0017
- Developing review documentation that demonstrates the protocol itself
**Learning**: Future ADR work should account for:
- 15-20 minutes per Breath-First section (not 5-10)
- Substantial revision cycles when governance boundaries are involved
- Documentation that teaches through demonstration takes 2x initial estimates

## Tracking Categories

### Quick Tasks (< 30 minutes AI time)
- Simple file edits
- Running validation scripts
- Status checks

### Standard Tasks (30 min - 2 hours AI time)
- Feature implementation
- Test writing
- Documentation updates

### Complex Tasks (2+ hours AI time)
- Architectural decisions
- Multi-file refactoring
- Philosophical alignment work
- Governance protocols

### Factors That Extend Time
- Breath-first alignment requirements
- High Council review cycles
- Human guardianship considerations
- Cross-domain integration
- Teaching through implementation

## Reflective Questions
1. Did the task require more philosophical alignment than expected?
2. Were there unexpected governance or boundary considerations?
3. Did the breath-first approach reveal deeper complexity?
4. How did human feedback cycles affect the timeline?
5. What patterns emerge in my estimation accuracy?
