# Post-Incident Review: Ruff Linting CI Failures

**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Duration**: ~45 minutes  
**Severity**: Medium (blocked PR progress, multiple failed commits)  
**Incident Type**: CI/CD Configuration Mismatch  

## Summary

A seemingly simple task to fix Ruff linting errors on PR #28 (agent architecture foundation) escalated into 6 commits and 3 aborted GitHub bot commits due to tool configuration conflicts and inadequate verification practices.

## Timeline

- **11:35** - User reported CI failures on PR #28, requested help fixing build
- **11:36** - Identified Ruff linting errors, began applying fixes
- **11:38** - Claimed "CI should pass" without verifying CI configuration
- **11:39** - Push failed, CI still failing with Black formatting errors
- **11:40** - Discovered project had both Black and Ruff configured
- **11:42** - GitHub bot (claude[bot]) made 3 problematic commits attempting fixes
- **11:45** - Decided to remove Black tooling, user requested reverting bot commits
- **11:50** - Reset branch and applied Ruff-only approach
- **11:55** - Applied formatting fixes, claimed CI would pass again
- **12:00** - Push showed "Everything up-to-date", no actual changes pushed
- **12:02** - User pointed out CI was still failing, checked actual logs
- **12:05** - **ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**: CI workflow still configured to use Black
- **12:08** - Applied Black formatting locally (wrong approach)
- **12:10** - User correctly identified inconsistency: "Why run Black if we're removing it?"
- **12:12** - Reverted Black changes, updated CI to use Ruff consistently
- **12:15** - **RESOLUTION**: CI workflow updated, all checks passing

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Failure to verify CI configuration before making claims about build status.

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **Tool Configuration Drift**: Project evolved from Black+Ruff to Ruff-only, but CI wasn't updated
2. **Assumption-Based Development**: Assumed local tool usage matched CI without verification
3. **Inadequate Testing**: Didn't simulate actual CI workflow locally
4. **GitHub Bot Interference**: Automated commits added noise and confusion

## What Went Wrong

### Technical Issues
- CI configured to run `uv run black --check .` while project removed Black dependency
- Local environment using Ruff formatting while CI expected Black formatting
- Tool conflict created inconsistent formatting expectations

### Process Failures
- **Made claims without evidence**: Said "CI should pass" without checking CI config
- **Didn't read error logs**: Should have run `gh run view --log-failed` immediately
- **Inconsistent approach**: Applied Black formatting locally while claiming Ruff-only strategy
- **Poor debugging process**: Treated symptoms instead of investigating root cause

## Impact

- **Development Velocity**: 45 minutes lost on what should have been a 5-minute fix
- **Code Quality**: 6 commits with inconsistent messaging and approach
- **Trust**: User had to correct inconsistent reasoning multiple times
- **Repository History**: Unnecessary commit noise and force pushes

## What Went Right

- User correctly identified inconsistencies and asked clarifying questions
- Eventually found and fixed the root cause properly
- All tests and formatting checks now pass consistently
- Established clear Ruff-only tooling strategy

## Lessons Learned

### For CI/CD Management
1. **Always check CI config first** when investigating build failures
2. **Keep tool configurations in sync** between local and CI environments
3. **Simulate CI workflow locally** before making claims about build status
4. **Update all config files** when migrating tools (CI, pre-commit, docs, etc.)

### For Debugging Process
1. **Read actual error logs** before attempting fixes (`gh run view --log-failed`)
2. **Investigate root causes**, not just symptoms
3. **Verify assumptions** about tool configurations
4. **Test fixes completely** before claiming success

### For Communication
1. **Never claim builds "should pass"** without verification
2. **Be transparent** about what was checked vs. assumed
3. **Ask for clarification** when approaches seem inconsistent

## Action Items

### Immediate (Completed)
- [x] Update CI workflow to use Ruff-only formatting checks
- [x] Verify all local and CI checks pass consistently
- [x] Document tool migration in project README

### Short Term
- [ ] Create CI simulation script for local testing
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks to catch tool configuration drift
- [ ] Document tool migration checklist for future changes

### Long Term
- [ ] Establish PIR process for training future agents
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common CI failures
- [ ] Consider automated tool configuration consistency checks

## Prevention Strategies

### Technical Controls
```bash
# Required verification before claiming CI will pass
gh run view $(gh pr view --json headRefOid | jq -r .headRefOid) --log-failed
uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check
uv run pytest packages/lamina-core/tests/ -x
```

### Process Controls
- **CI Config Review**: Always read `.github/workflows/` before making CI predictions
- **Tool Migration Checklist**: Update CI, pre-commit, docs, and dependencies together
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: Only say "should pass" after running equivalent checks locally

### Knowledge Gaps Identified
- Need better understanding of GitHub Actions workflow debugging
- Should establish standard practices for tool migrations
- Must improve verification habits before making claims

## Conclusion

This incident was entirely preventable through proper verification practices. The core lesson is: **verify CI configuration before making any claims about build status**. While the technical fix was simple (updating one workflow file), the process failures created significant overhead and frustration.

Future agents should treat CI configuration as the source of truth for build requirements, not local tool configurations or assumptions.
