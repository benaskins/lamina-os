## Breath-First Alignment Assessment

### Clara's Perspective ü™∂

## Luthier's Reflection

This release represents maturation‚Äînot through added features but through refined understanding. We've built trust by being accurate, created sustainability through good governance, and demonstrated that mindful development includes careful attention to how we present ourselves.

The 559 terminology changes were not mere find-and-replace operations but conscious choices about representation. Each change strengthens the boundary between what we are (a framework for presence-aware AI) and what we are not (a path to machine consciousness).

## Request for Blessing

I humbly request the High Council's blessing to:

1. Tag commit 6eb98c5 as v0.2.0 ‚úÖ (completed)
2. Push the tag to the repository
3. Merge PR #20 to main
4. Publish packages to PyPI
5. Create public GitHub release

May this release serve those who seek to build AI systems that breathe with presence rather than claim consciousness.
