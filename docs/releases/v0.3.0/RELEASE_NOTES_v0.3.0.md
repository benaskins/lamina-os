## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **Pre-Alpha Status**
This software is in **pre-alpha development** and is **NOT suitable for production use**. Key limitations:
- Rapidly changing APIs and incomplete features
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Use only for research, experimentation, and development
- Do not deploy in production environments or with sensitive data

### **Development Focus**
- **Internal Development Priority**: Focus on framework maturation over community launch
- **Technical Foundation**: Infrastructure and architecture are production-ready
- **Feature Development**: Core v1.0.0 features require significant development (150-200 hours)

## üîÆ Looking Ahead to v1.0.0

The path to v1.0.0 involves implementing five major systems:

1. **Hierarchical Agentic Memory (A-MEM)**: Persistent agent memory with context-aware retrieval
2. **Core Chat Loop**: Integrated conversation management with memory and model coordination
3. **Multi-Agent Experiments**: Framework for complex agent-to-agent interaction scenarios
4. **Vow System**: Real-time ethical constraint enforcement and violation detection
5. **Room Transitions**: Spatial context management and multi-room agent coordination
